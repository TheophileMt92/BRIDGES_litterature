AB Purpose The performance of nature reserves depends on the degree to which they represent a region's full biodiversity. Here, we conducted a study on Hainan Island, China, to assess how well Hainan's biodiversity features were captured by existing nature reserves. We also explored the driving forces behind the current protection pattern so as to provide guidelines for improving the island's conservation system.
   Methods We integrated the information on nature reserves, ecological variables, and human activities into a spatial database, then assessed the performance of nature reserves in representing natural variation, vegetation types, and species, and examined the impacts of human activities and land ownership on the current protection pattern.
   Results About 8.4% of Hainan Island was protected by nature reserves; the coverage was geographically biased toward its central mountainous areas with higher elevation, rugged terrain, and fertile soils. We found that 60% of the environmental units and 39.4% of the natural vegetation types had more than 10% of their area protected, respectively. Lowlands tended to have higher animal species richness, and the protection for endangered species was less efficient. Nature reserve coverage was negatively correlated with amount of converted habitats, human population density, and road density, and 82.4% of the total reserved area was allocated on state-owned land.
   Conclusions Nature reserve coverage was not enough to capture lowlands biodiversity features. The current protection pattern was significantly driven by several major conservation targets, human development, planning methods, and land ownership. To improve its conservation system, Hainan should enhance protection in the north and northeast plains and coastal regions, implement systematic planning approaches to define clear visions for guiding future conservation actions, and develop flexible management and funding mechanisms toward sustainable use of natural resources.

AB Aim To identify priority areas for amphibian conservation in southeastern Brazil, by integrating species life-history traits and patterns of deforestation.
   Location State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Methods We used the software Marxan to evaluate different scenarios of amphibian conservation planning. Our approach differs from previous methods by explicitly including two different landscape metrics; habitat split for species with aquatic larvae, and habitat loss for species with terrestrial development. We evaluated the effect of habitat requirements by classifying species breeding habitats in five categories (flowing water, still water permanent, still water temporary, bromeliad or bamboo, and terrestrial). We performed analyses using two scales, grid cells and watersheds and also considered nature preserves as protected areas.
   Results We found contrasting patterns of deforestation between coastal and inland regions. Seventy-six grid cells and 14 watersheds are capable of representing each species at least once. When accounting for grid cells already protected in state and national parks and considering species habitat requirements we found 16 high-priority grid cells for species with one or two reproductive habitats, and only one cell representing species with four habitat requirements. Key areas for the conservation of species breeding in flowing and permanent still waters are concentrated in southern state, while those for amphibians breeding in temporary ponds are concentrated in central to eastern zones. Eastern highland zones are key areas for preserving species breeding terrestrially by direct or indirect development. Species breeding in bromeliads and bamboos are already well represented in protected areas.
   Main conclusions Our results emphasize the need to integrate information on landscape configuration and species life-history traits to produce more ecologically relevant conservation strategies.

AB There is an increasing awareness in Chile of the need to improve the representation of the country's forest types in the national network of protected areas, and to reduce the impacts of the native forest conversion to other land uses. One promising strategy is to use the principles of systematic conservation planning to identify important areas for the conservation of biodiversity. In this chapter we use information on the vulnerability of native forest to threatening processes and information on the distribution of forest types to systematically determine priorities for biodiversity conservation in the temperate forest region of south-central Chile. We find that the existing reserve network covers approximately 12% of the study region, and that only 53% of the area of native forest estimated to be present before European settlement remained in 1997. Temperate forest is now largely restricted to the upper elevations of the Andean and coastal ranges, within a matrix of pasture, agriculture and plantations. We develop a model of the conversion of native forest to plantations and predict conversion to be more likely in warm and low rainfall areas that are close to towns and roads and on red clay and mixed alluvial soils. We argue that the priority areas for conservation should be currently unprotected areas that are vulnerable to plantation conversion and that, if lost or degraded, will result in conservation targets being compromised. We find the Evergreen forest type to be a priority for conservation owing to its lack of representation in the existing reserve network and the degree to which it has been cleared. By focusing our conservation efforts on areas with the greatest conservation value and the highest likelihood of losing significant portions of this value, we will be able to achieve maximum impact for conservation investments in south-central Chile.

AB Aim Islands are one of the most threatened worldwide biotas. Based on their taxonomic diversity, some insular regions have been identified as key areas of conservation. Recently, systematic conservation planning has advocated for the use of multiple biodiversity facets to protect unique evolutionary and functional processes. Here, we identified priority areas for threatened insular endemic mammals across three key dimensions of biodiversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional), as well as their protection level and threats affecting them. Location Worldwide. Methods We applied diversity-area relationships to identify insular regions that harbored a disproportionately high rate of threatened endemic mammal diversity (whether taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional) given their area for 1,799 islands across 19 insular regions. We also assessed the level of protection and the threats affecting biodiversity within each insular region. Results We showed a fairly good congruence between top-ranked insular regions based on taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity. Specifically, we identified four hotspots for endemic mammalian conservation through the three diversity facets: Indo-Burma, Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Islands, Mesoamerica and Galapagos Islands, and Wallacea. Except for Mesoamerica and Galapagos Islands, the protected areas coverage is low (<8%) within the hotspots. We also showed that most of the mammal species occurring in the hotspots was prone to either direct threats that affect their mortality or indirect threats that only alter their habitat, while mixed threats such as biological invasions or climate change were less represented in those regions. Main conclusions Our findings reinforce the importance of investigating the multiple diversity facets in a conservation concern and to link with the associated threats to ensure an effective conservation strategy.

AB GuardIAS is a three-year Horizon Europe project starting in January 2025, uniting diverse expertise to address aquatic invasive alien species (IAS) management. This multidisciplinary initiative comprises seven interconnected work packages targeting all invasion stages (pre-border, border, post-border) to develop tools for disrupting invasions. GuardIAS will employ Artificial Intelligence and data workflows to enhance biodiversity databases with species distributions, environmental tolerances, traits, and genetic information, thereby improving the European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN) and harmonizing key datasets. The citizen science platform iNaturalist will be enriched with expert-verified images of aquatic IAS for early detection and monitoring of geographic spread. An Early Warning System focused on IAS of EU concern will be developed and integrated into EASIN. To prevent hull biofouling-a major IAS introduction pathway-GuardIAS will explore nanotechnology-based antifouling coatings. The project will also investigate recreational boat movements along European coastlines, an understudied factor in IAS secondary dispersal. An eDNA reference library and assay panel will be developed for effective IAS detection. Advanced models, such as the Nobel Prize winning Multi-Region Input-Output analysis, will assess IAS risks, including impacts on threatened species and critical habitats under current and future scenarios. Systematic conservation planning tools will prioritize IAS monitoring and management actions based on their impacts. GuardIAS will enhance data collection, monitoring, early detection, and public awareness through innovative citizen science initiatives like BioArtBlitz events-where arts serve as a communication vehicle- eDNA sampling, sound analysis projects on Zooniverse, and marina events for boaters. Stakeholder engagement will be fostered through applied games. Collaborating with environmental authorities, industry, and aquatic managers, the project will co-design and implement eradication and control efforts in marine and freshwater environments. By integrating Social Sciences and Humanities, GuardIAS will promote collaborative knowledge creation, understand public perceptions on IAS management, and facilitate exploitation of the project's outcomes.

AB In the tenth Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) held in Nagoya in 2010, it was decided that 17% of terrestrial and 10% of marine areas should be protected globally by 2020. It was also stated that conservation decision-making should be based on sound science. Here, we review how recent scientific literature about spatial conservation prioritization analyses and macro-ecology corresponds to the information needs posed by the Aichi Biodiversity Target 11. A literature search was performed in Web of Science to identify potentially relevant research articles published in 2010-2012. Additionally, we searched all articles published since 2000 in five high-profile scientific journals. The studies were classified by extent and resolution, and we evaluated the type and breadth of data that was utilized (This information is included in a supplementary table to facilitate further research). Implementation of the Aichi Targets would best be supported by broad-extent, high-resolution, and data-rich studies that can directly support realistic decision-making about allocation of conservation efforts at sub-continental to global extents. When looking at all evaluation criteria simultaneously, we found little research that directly supports the analytical needs of the CBD. There are many narrow-extent, low-resolution, narrow-scope, or theoretically-aimed studies that are important in developing theory and local practices, but which are not adequate for guiding conservation management at a continental scale. Even national analyses are missing for many countries. Global-extent, high-resolution analyses using broad biodiversity and anthropogenic data are needed in order to inform decision making under the CBD resolutions.

AB P>1. Freshwater conservation has received less attention than its terrestrial or marine counterparts. Given the accelerated rate of change and intensive human use that freshwater ecosystems are submitted to, it is urgent to focus more attention on fresh waters. Existing conservation planning tools - such as Marxan - need to be modified to account for the special nature of these systems. Connectivity plays a key role in freshwater ecosystems. Threats are mediated along river corridors, and the condition of the entire catchment influences river biodiversity downstream. This needs to be considered in conservation planning.
   2. The probabilities of occurrence of nine native freshwater fish species in a Mediterranean river basin, obtained from Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines- Generalized Linear Model (MARS-GLM) models, were used as features to develop spatial conservation priorities. The priorities accounted for complementarity and spatial design issues.
   3. To deal with the connected nature of rivers, we modified Marxan's boundary length penalty, avoiding the selection of isolated planning units and forcing the inclusion of closer upstream areas. We introduced 'virtual boundaries' between non-headwater stream segments and added distance-weighted penalties to the overall connectivity cost (CP) when stream segments upstream of the selected planning units are not selected.
   4. This approach to prioritising connectivity is concordant with ecological theory, as it considers the natural and roughly exponential decay of upstream influences with distance. It accounts for the natural capacity of rivers to mitigate impacts when designing reserves. When connectivity was not emphasised, Marxan prioritised natural corridors for longitudinal movements. In contrast, whole sub-basins were prioritised when connectivity was emphasised. Changing the relative emphasis on connectivity substantially changed the spatial prioritisation; our conservation investment could move from one basin to another.
   5. Our novel approach to dealing with directional connectivity enables managers of freshwater systems to set ecologically meaningful spatial conservation priorities.

AB AimThe concept of nestedness is important in determining the relative contribution to overall system diversity of different habitat patches within a fragmented system. Much of the previous work on nestedness has focused on islands within oceans (islands sensu stricto). The largest analysis of habitat island systems to date found significant nestedness to be a near universal feature, but the methods used have since been criticized as inappropriate. Thus, there is a need for an updated, critical examination of the prevalence, underlying drivers and implications of nestedness in multiple habitat island systems.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsHere, we collate 97 datasets from published habitat island studies, comprising multiple taxa. We use the NODF metric (nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing fill) to estimate nestedness and determine significance using the four-step proportional-proportional algorithm to simulate presences/absence matrices. We investigate the role of habitat island area in driving observed nestedness. We use linear modelling to examine the impact of dataset characteristics on the degree of nestedness and assess the conservation biogeographic implications of nestedness in relation to strategic conservation planning.
   ResultsSignificant nestedness occurred in only 9% of systems, whilst anti-nestedness (i.e. datasets less nested than expected by chance) occurred in 16% of systems. For the majority of datasets found to be significantly nested, we observed a relationship with fragment area, suggesting that structured extinctions may be important in determining the composition of certain habitat island communities. We found that the degree of nestedness in an archipelago is an important consideration for systematic conservation planning.
   Main conclusionsSignificant nestedness is considerably less common in habitat islands than previously reported. Strategic guidance for conservation planning should proceed on a case by case basis, and previous conservation recommendations based on the assumption of significant nestedness in most fragmented landscapes may need to be re-evaluated.

AB Global agreement on 30x30 means an unprecedented last push to define how much nature will be left on the planet. At the same time that space for nature is being defined, climate change will be moving nature around. Species are now on the move to track climate change both on land and in the oceans, a process that is accelerating under dramatic new extreme events. This is an opportune time to review conservation recommendations made early in the millennium, to see how many have been taken on board over the past 20 years, and how much is left to be done to adapt to climate change as conservation pushes toward 30x30. The history of Climate Change-Integrated Conservation Strategies begins with two papers published by a group of prominent climate change biologists in 2002. The importance of including adaptation to climate change in conservation was underscored by the first estimates of extinction risk due to climate change in 2004. Subsequent literature has developed concepts such as velocity of climate change and assisted migration. Regional modeling of biodiversity change, expanding protected areas to facilitate species range movements, and managing productive landscapes to facilitate species movements are all now considered "business as usual" for conservation planning for climate change. Regional coordination of conservation efforts to ensure that species on the move are managed for climate change consistently across their range, on the other hand, is under-represented in literature and practice. Improving both theory and practice of regional coordination for climate change is an important priority for conservation now and in the future. Conservation for climate change has focused mostly on warming scenarios, but failure to act on climate change emissions reduction means that meeting Paris Agreement targets will almost certainly have to include both warming past those targets and subsequent cooling back to the target. Managing this double transition is a second critical point of emphasis for climate change biology as the world moves to 30x30.

AB Because of limitation of manpower, funding, and land available in conservation, the problem of how to select essential regions to establish protection systems for biodiversity maintenance has been widely discussed. In an effort to address the problem, this study has aimed to select a set of priority areas and to determine their priority order by quantifying human disturbances for each area in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). This basin covers 2.143 million km(2), or more than 20% of China's territory. The habitats of 627 indicator species were predicted as a proxy for biodiversity. A conservation planning tool, MARXAN, was used to determine the optimal set of planning units, and three different target scenarios were generated. In addition, under the assumption that if two areas have equal value for conservation, the one suffering more severe disturbance needs more urgent protection than the other, priority ranking analysis was carried out using a 6-12-1 BP artificial neural network. Then hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to the classifications of human disturbances to formulate more detailed conservation strategies. By integrating the degree of irreplaceability of each unit, expert experience, and mountain boundaries, 17 biodiversity priority areas containing 33,200 units over an area of 0.83 million km(2) were defined. These areas also protected 56% of 32 types of rare forest ecosystem and 76.4% of six types of rare grassland ecosystem on average. According to the evaluation of human impact, a priority order and five types of human disturbance areas were generated. Some protection gaps were also identified, such as the northern part of the Wuyi Mountains. Moreover, the determination of priority nature conservation areas on a large scale can be used to influence the building of a well-connected protection network in each individual area, so that effective genetic communication can occur between species or groups of species. Conservation decisions focusing on the dominant impact factors that are threatening biodiversity sustainability are required as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB The Humboldt Current System (HCS) is one of the most productive marine ecosystems on earth. It extends along the west coast of South America from southern Chile (similar to 42 degrees S) up to Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands near the equator. The general oceanography of the HCS is characterised by a predominant northward flow of surface waters of subantarctic origin and by strong upwelling of cool nutrient-rich subsurface waters of equatorial origin. Along the coast of northern and central Chile, upwelling is localised and its occurrence changes from being mostly continuous (aseasonal) in northern Chile to a more seasonal pattern in southern-central Chile. Several important upwelling centres along the Chilean coast are interspersed with long stretches of coast without or with sporadic and less intense upwelling. Large-scale climatic phenomena (El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO) are superimposed onto this regional pattern, which results in a high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, complicating the prediction of ecological processes along the Chilean coast. This limited predictability becomes particularly critical in light of increasing human activities during the past decades, at present mainly in the form of exploitation of renewable resources (fish, invertebrates and macroalgae). This review examines current knowledge of ecological processes in the HCS of northern and central Chile, with a particular focus on oceanographic factors and the influence of human activities, and further suggests conservation strategies for this high-priority large marine ecosystem. Along the Chilean coast, the injection of nutrients into surface waters through upwelling events results in extremely high primary production. This fuels zooplankton and fish production over extensive areas, which also supports higher trophic levels, including large populations of seabirds and marine mammals. Pelagic fisheries, typically concentrated near main upwelling centres (20-22 degrees S, 32-34 degrees S, 36-38 degrees S), take an important share of the fish production, thereby affecting trophic interactions in the HCS. Interestingly, El Nino (EN) events in northern Chile do not appear to cause a dramatic decline in primary or zooplankton production but rather a shift in species composition, which affects trophic efficiency of and interactions among higher-level consumers. The low oxygen concentrations in subsurface waters of the HCS (oxygen-minimum zone, OMZ) influence predator-prey interactions in the plankton by preventing some species from migrating to deeper waters. The OMZ also has a strong effect on the bathymetric distribution of sublittoral soft-bottom communities along the Chilean coast. The few long-term studies available from sublittoral soft-bottom communities in northern and central Chile suggest that temporal dynamics in abundance and community composition are driven by interannual phenomena (EN and the extent and intensity of the OMZ) rather than by intra-annual (seasonal) patterns. Macrobenthic communities within the OMZ are often dominated in biomass by sulphide-oxidising, mat-forming bacteria. Though the contribution of these microbial communities to the total primary production of the system and their function in structuring OMZ communities is still scarcely known, they presumably play a key role, also in sustaining large populations of economically valuable crustaceans.
   Sublittoral hard bottoms in shallow waters are dominated by macroalgae and suspension-feeder reefs, which concentrate planktonic resources (nutrients and suspended matter) and channel them into benthic food wbs. These communities persist for many years and local extinctions appear to be mainly driven by large-scale events such as EN, which causes direct mortality of benthic organisms due to lack of nutrients/food, high water temperatures, or burial under terrigenous sediments from river runoff. Historic extinctions in combination with local conditions (e.g., vicinity to upwelling centres or substratum availability) produce a heterogeneous distribution pattern of benthic communities, which is also reflected in the diffuse biogeographic limits along the coast of northern-central Chile. Studies of population connectivity suggest that species with highly mobile planktonic dispersal stages maintain relatively continuous populations throughout most of the HCS, while populations of species with limited planktonic dispersal appear to feature high genetic structure over small spatial scales. The population dynamics of most species in the HCS are further influenced by geographic variation in propagule production (apparently caused by local differences in primary production), by temporal variation in recruit supply (caused by upwelling events, frontal systems and eddies), and topographically driven propagule retention (behind headlands, in bay systems and upwelling shadows). Adults as well as larval stages show a wide range of different physiological, ecological and reproductive adaptations. This diversity in life-history strategies in combination with the high variability in environmental conditions (currents, food availability, predation risk, environmental stress) causes strong fluctuations in stocks of both planktonic and benthic resources. At present, it remains difficult to predict many of these fluctuations, which poses particular challenges for the management of exploited resources and the conservation of biodiversity in the HCS. The high spatiotemporal variability in factors affecting ecological processes and the often-unpredictable outcome call for fine-scale monitoring of recruitment and stock dynamics. In order to translate this ecological information into sustainable use of resources, adaptive and co-participative management plans are recommended. Identification of areas with high biodiversity, source and sink regions for propagules and connectivity among local populations together with developing a systematic conservation planning, which incorporates decision support systems, are. important tasks that need to be resolved in order to create an efficient network of Marine Protected Areas along the coast of northern-central Chile. Farther offshore, the continental shelf and the deep-sea trenches off the Chilean coast play an important role in bio-geochemical cycles, which may be highly sensitive to climatic change. Research in this area should be intensified, for which modern research vessels are required. Biodiversity inventories must be accompanied by efforts to foster taxonomic expertise and museum collections (which should integrate morphological and molecular information). Conservation goals set for the next decade can only be achieved with the incorporation of local stakeholders and the establishment of efficient administrative structures.
   The dynamic system of the HCS in northern-central Chile can only be understood and managed efficiently if a fluent communication between stakeholders, administrators, scientists and politician is guaranteed.

AB Systematic conservation planning has a substantial theoretical underpinning that allows optimization of tradeoffs between biodiversity conservation and other socioeconomic goals. However, this theory assumes perfect spatial information about the locations of biodiversity features (e.g., species distributions). In practice, planners represent well-known taxa and other biodiversity "surrogates" in protected area systems, hoping that unmapped species will also be conserved. However, empirical research finds that surrogates predict species presence imperfectly, and sometimes rather poorly, at scales relevant to planning, and existing theory provides no further guidance. We developed new theory, explicitly incorporating aspects of spatial scale, for the representation problem when the locations of species distributions are unknown. Using probability theory and simulated and real species distributions, we found that the probability of adequately representing an unmapped species in a protected area system will be low unless the total fraction of the region being protected is larger than the species representation target. Furthermore, successful conservation depended critically on the relative sizes of the species distribution and of the individual protected areas; fewer, larger protected areas allowed the entire species distribution to fall into an unprotected gap. This scale-dependence varied with the configuration of the protected area system, with the conservation objective most likely to be attained if the individual protected areas were hyperdispersed (evenly spaced across the planning region). Using these results, we developed three design principles for representing unmapped species in protected areas: (1) The fraction of the region placed in protected areas should be substantially larger than the species-level representation target; (2) Individual protected areas must be at least one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the unmapped species' distribution; and (3) Protected areas should be evenly dispersed over geographic space. We also performed preliminary investigations of the effects of surrogates and socio-economic cost data on the probability of adequately representing unmapped species, finding that the primary effect of surrogates may simply be to promote hyperdispersion of protected areas across the planning region, and that seeking to minimize opportunity costs gives poorer conservation results than random protected area placement.

AB 1. This study has adapted a complementarity-based area-selection method to estimate conservation value/irreplaceability for river systems. Irreplaceability represents the likelihood that an area will be required as part of a conservation system that achieves all conservation targets. We adapt this measure - often used in marine or terrestrial planning - to consider whole-of-catchment protection in a riverine setting.
   2. After dividing the Australian state of Victoria into 1854 subcatchments, we successfully modelled distributions of 400 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa using generalized additive models. We calculated the minimum area required to protect all taxa using three different heuristic selection algorithms. The algorithms were modified to consider the entire upstream catchment for any subcatchment.
   3. A summed rarity algorithm, corrected for upstream area, proved to be the most efficient, requiring 100 000 hectares less total catchment area to represent all taxa than the second most efficient algorithm. We calculated irreplaceability by running the algorithm 1000 times and randomly removing 90% of the catchments in each run. From this analysis, we estimated two metrics: Fs (the frequency of selection) and average c (average contribution to conservation targets).
   4. Four groups of catchments were identified: (i) catchments that have high contributions and are always or very frequently selected; (ii) catchments that have high contributions and are infrequently selected; (iii) catchments that are always or very frequently selected but contribute few taxa; and (iv) catchments that are infrequently selected and contribute few taxa.
   5. Synthesis and applications. For the first time, a complementarity-based algorithm has been adapted to a riverine setting. This algorithm acknowledges the connected nature of rivers by considering not only the local assemblages, but also upstream areas that need to be protected. We demonstrated that using standard algorithms in these connected systems would lead to two mistakes, namely: (i) not all taxa would be covered by reserves that were buffered from potential human disturbances upstream; and (ii) the standard algorithms would not lead to the most efficient solution, potentially costing additional millions of dollars to any conservation scheme. We therefore recommend the use of our algorithm or a similar riverine adaptation of reserve design algorithms to ensure adequate and efficient conservation planning.

AB Biodiversity conservation relies heavily on protected areas (PAs). However, in locations that are desirable for agriculture, industry, or human habitation (e.g., lowland habitats on fertile soils, coastal zones), land is often privately owned and state-owned PAs tend to be under-represented. Despite the potentially disproportionate contribution that privately protected areas (PPAs) could make to representing biodiversity and supporting its persistence across regional PA estates, this contribution is poorly understood. We assessed the capacity of PPAs to contribute to the persistence of 38 large- and medium-sized mammals in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa, based on a previously published conservation plan that used species population requirements to identify areas of importance for mammal conservation. We hypothesized that, relative to state-owned PAs, PPAs would be disproportionately located in areas important to the regional persistence of the mammal assemblage, given: (a) historic biases in the distribution of private- and state-owned land across high and low productivity landscapes, respectively; (b) private landholders' recent focus on wildlife-orientated enterprises; and (c) the conservation trade-offs influencing expansions of the state-owned PA estate. As a result of the high numbers of PPAs and their bias towards areas of importance for mammal conservation, the potential mammal species diversity and richness that could persist within a PA increased more rapidly with PA size on PPAs than on state-owned PAs. These PPAs therefore have the potential to significantly increase both the regional-scale diversity of protected mammals and the number of viable populations. Furthermore, PPAs could make the greatest absolute contribution to the conservation of protected species when adjoining, and thus expanding, state-owned PAs (i.e., mixed-ownership PAs). Regional conservation targets for a quarter of the species were only met due to the inclusion of private- and/or mixed-ownership PAs in the estate. Policy implications. Our findings show that privately protected areas (PPAs) could play a substantial role in the long-term conservation of terrestrial megafauna within a multi-tenure protected area (PA) estate, due to their prevalence in high-productivity landscapes. The significant gains from augmenting state-owned PAs with PPAs emphasize the value of systematic conservation planning and implementation across tenure types.

AB As nations seek to expand protected area (PA) networks to cover 30% of land and seas by 2030 (30x30), there is an urgent need for systematic conservation planning and spatial prioritization that considers the broad range of ecological and socioeconomic factors influencing the persistence of biodiversity. A remaining challenge in spatial prioritization is identifying areas that not only contribute to ecological connectivity but also are vulnerable to isolation and connectivity decline caused by anthropogenic disturbance. We devised an approach to assess PA networks and prioritize areas for conservation action and applied it to the Swedish coastal Baltic Sea area as an example. We developed connectivity models for 16 key fish species to identify habitats that provide the greatest contributions to maintaining network connectivity. We then incorporated spatial data on anthropogenic disturbance into the connectivity models to identify habitats for which human activities may hinder dispersal and recruitment, making them vulnerable to local population declines. We assessed the adequacy of the marine protected area (MPA) network in protecting these biodiversity features. Using spatial prioritization with explicit objectives to protect these biodiversity features, we then identified important areas for future protection. Although the Swedish MPA network provided a reasonable level of protection for these key habitats, their protection in stricter MPA categories (International Union for Conservation of Nature categories Ia, Ib, and II) was poor. Expanding the MPA network from its current coverage (10.5% of the study area) to 11%, the mean protection level across features increased from 25% to 48%. Expanding to 15% coverage increased mean protection across features to over 90%. Our approach to conservation planning incorporated not only biodiversity data (e.g., habitats and connectivity) but also the pressures these elements of biodiversity are susceptible to from human activities.
   Identificaci & oacute;n de las & aacute;reas prioritarias para la conservaci & oacute;n para promover la conectividad y mitigar el impacto de la perturbaci & oacute;n antropog & eacute;nica A medida que los pa & iacute;ses intentan ampliar las redes de & aacute;reas protegidas para cubrir el 30% de la tierra y los mares en 2030 (30 x 30), surge la necesidad urgente de una planificaci & oacute;n sistem & aacute;tica de la conservaci & oacute;n y una priorizaci & oacute;n espacial que tenga en cuenta la amplia gama de factores ecol & oacute;gicos y socioecon & oacute;micos que influyen en la persistencia de la biodiversidad. Un reto pendiente en la priorizaci & oacute;n espacial es la identificaci & oacute;n de & aacute;reas que no s & oacute;lo contribuyen a la conectividad ecol & oacute;gica, sino que tambi & eacute;n son vulnerables al aislamiento y al declive de la conectividad causados por perturbaciones antropog & eacute;nicas. Hemos ideado un enfoque para evaluar las redes de & aacute;reas protegidas y priorizar las zonas que requieren medidas de conservaci & oacute;n, y lo hemos aplicado a la zona costera sueca del Mar B & aacute;ltico a modo de ejemplo. Desarrollamos modelos de conectividad para 16 especies de peces clave con el fin de identificar los h & aacute;bitats que m & aacute;s contribuyen a mantener la conectividad de la red. Despu & eacute;s, incorporamos datos espaciales sobre perturbaciones antropog & eacute;nicas a los modelos de conectividad para identificar los h & aacute;bitats en los que las actividades humanas pueden dificultar la dispersi & oacute;n y el reclutamiento, lo que los hace vulnerables al declive de las poblaciones locales. Evaluamos la idoneidad de la red de & aacute;reas marinas protegidas (AMP) para proteger estas caracter & iacute;sticas de la biodiversidad. Mediante la priorizaci & oacute;n espacial con objetivos expl & iacute;citos de protecci & oacute;n de estas caracter & iacute;sticas de biodiversidad, identificamos & aacute;reas importantes para su futura protecci & oacute;n. Aunque la red sueca de AMP ofrec & iacute;a un nivel razonable de protecci & oacute;n de estos h & aacute;bitats clave, su protecci & oacute;n en categor & iacute;as de AMP m & aacute;s estrictas (categor & iacute;as Ia, Ib y II de la Uni & oacute;n Internacional para la Conservaci & oacute;n de la Naturaleza) era deficiente. Al ampliar la red de AMP de su cobertura actual (10.5% de la zona de estudio) al 11%, el nivel medio de protecci & oacute;n de todas las caracter & iacute;sticas aument & oacute; del 25% al 48%. La ampliaci & oacute;n a una cobertura del 15% aument & oacute; la protecci & oacute;n media de las caracter & iacute;sticas a m & aacute;s del 90%. Nuestro enfoque de la planificaci & oacute;n de la conservaci & oacute;n incorpor & oacute; no s & oacute;lo datos sobre biodiversidad (por ejemplo, h & aacute;bitats y conectividad), sino tambi & eacute;n las presiones a las que estos elementos de la biodiversidad son susceptibles de ser sometidos por las actividades humanas. ResumenIdentificaci & oacute;n de las & aacute;reas prioritarias para la conservaci & oacute;n para promover la conectividad y mitigar el impacto de la perturbaci & oacute;n antropog & eacute;nica A medida que los pa & iacute;ses intentan ampliar las redes de & aacute;reas protegidas para cubrir el 30% de la tierra y los mares en 2030 (30 x 30), surge la necesidad urgente de una planificaci & oacute;n sistem & aacute;tica de la conservaci&AM
   Un reto pendiente en la priorizaci & oacute;n espacial es la identificaci & oacute;n de & aacute;reas que no s & oacute;lo contribuyen a la conectividad ecol & oacute;gica, sino que tambi & eacute;n son vulnerables al aislamiento y al declive de la conectividad causados por perturbaciones antropog & eacute;nicas. Hemos ideado un enfoque para evaluar las redes de & aacute;reas protegidas y priorizar las zonas que requieren medidas de conservaci & oacute;n, y lo hemos aplicado a la zona costera sueca del Mar B & aacute;ltico a modo de ejemplo. Desarrollamos modelos de conectividad para 16 especies de peces clave con el fin de identificar los h & aacute;bitats que m & aacute;s contribuyen a mantener la conectividad de la red. Despu & eacute;s, incorporamos datos espaciales sobre perturbaciones antropog & eacute;nicas a los modelos de conectividad para identificar los h & aacute;bitats en los que las actividades humanas pueden dificultar la dispersi & oacute;n y el reclutamiento, lo que los hace vulnerables al declive de las poblaciones locales. Evaluamos la idoneidad de la red de & aacute;reas marinas protegidas (AMP) para proteger estas caracter & iacute;sticas de la biodiversidad. Mediante la priorizaci & oacute;n espacial con objetivos expl & iacute;citos de protecci & oacute;n de estas caracter & iacute;sticas de biodiversidad, identificamos & aacute;reas importantes para su futura protecci & oacute;n. Aunque la red sueca de AMP ofrec & iacute;a un nivel razonable de protecci & oacute;n de estos h & aacute;bitats clave, su protecci & oacute;n en categor & iacute;as de AMP m & aacute;s estrictas (categor & iacute;as Ia, Ib y II de la Uni & oacute;n Internacional para la Conservaci & oacute;n de la Naturaleza) era deficiente. Al ampliar la red de AMP de su cobertura actual (10.5% de la zona de estudio) al 11%, el nivel medio de protecci & oacute;n de todas las caracter & iacute;sticas aument & oacute; del 25% al 48%. La ampliaci & oacute;n a una cobertura del 15% aument & oacute; la protecci & oacute;n media de las caracter & iacute;sticas a m & aacute;s del 90%. Nuestro enfoque de la planificaci & oacute;n de la conservaci & oacute;n incorpor & oacute; no s & oacute;lo datos sobre biodiversidad (por ejemplo, h & aacute;bitats y conectividad), sino tambi & eacute;n las presiones a las que estos elementos de la biodiversidad son susceptibles de ser sometidos por las actividades humanas.

AB Successful long-term conservation relies on strategic planning for pragmatic actions to mitigate threats. Prioritizing actions and areas to support conservation goals in the most cost-effective scenario becomes crucial in resource-limited environments. However, planning and management can be challenging in data-limited contexts. Incorporating local ecological knowledge (LEK) into conservation planning is an underexplored method of addressing these knowledge gaps. We utilized systematic conservation planning to identify key sites for seahorse threat management in a complex social-ecological system in a protected area. Through participatory mapping and interviews with artisanal fishers, we gathered insights about seahorses, threats to them, and their socioeconomic significance for the local community. We compared LEK-derived seahorse conservation priorities with spatial priorities identified using Marxan and with LEK-derived and science-derived data to explore LEK's contribution to spatial planning for a data-poor species and to explore different seahorse threat management scenarios. The LEK-derived and science-derived seahorse abundance Marxan scenarios had a strong spatial agreement, emphasizing LEK's role in conservation planning. Furthermore, LEK-derived data filled key data gaps on the distribution and nature of water-based threats. Threat management scenarios for land and water-based threat management had distinct spatial patterns. Incorporating LEK into decision-making empowered local communities and thus fostered community-based management. These findings offer insights into conservation planning in data-deficient scenarios and can aid decision makers and local stakeholders in inclusive conservation strategies. Our results identified priorities for seahorse conservation in the Rio Formoso Estuary and our methods offer a transferable approach for participatory and interdisciplinary planning, which are essential for biodiversity conservation and livelihoods maintenance.

AB The 30x30 commitment outlined in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF) offers a critical opportunity for enhancing global biodiversity conservation. However, KM-GBF's efforts to address climate change impacts remain limited. We developed 1-km-resolution hotspot maps for climate change vulnerability with the exposure-sensitivity-adaptation framework, species distribution for 4 terrestrial vertebrate taxa, and carbon stock capacity including organic and biomass carbon, for 2030. Then, we developed a systematic conservation planning approach that, beyond the 3 conservation features mentioned, also considered human activities, connectivity, and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. The plan included the identification of conservation priorities and gaps for China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations region (China-ASEAN) at regional, national, and biogeographical scales. We found that 6.59% of the land in China-ASEAN overlapped all 3 hotspots, primarily in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia. Across all 3 spatial scales, newly identified conservation priorities were concentrated in low-elevation areas, particularly between 10 degrees S and 10 degrees N at the regional scale. Currently, protected areas cover 15.49% of China-ASEAN's land, representing 7.00% of climate change vulnerability hotspots, 12.45% of species distribution potential hotspots, and 14.56% of carbon stock capacity hotspots for 2030. If the 30x30 commitment is realized at a regional scale, these percentages are expected to increase to 22.93%, 33.15%, and 34.75%, respectively. Areas of conservation priority identified with our framework were significantly affected by the scale of protection coordination, yet they remained stable across Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, indicating their effectiveness in diverse future scenarios. The biogeographical scale had the smallest average conservation gap for all 12 countries (13.14%). Financial challenges are highest for Indonesia at the regional scale and for Malaysia at the national and biogeographical scales. Precise conservation based on appropriate scales is essential to achieving the 30x30 commitment and maximizing its conservation effectiveness under climate change.
