AB The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is a federal agency that provides financial and technical assistance to farmers to aid them with soil and water conservation. NRCS offers no-fee technical assistance and conservation planning through the Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) program, which encourages farmers to engage in voluntary conservation practices without financial incentives. As part of a wider study evaluating farmer participation in the CTA program in West Virginia, and NRCS's organizational capacity to deliver it, a spatial modeling process was adapted to identify the sample population. This CTA program participation spatial modeling process utilized applied CTA practice points to conduct hot spot analyses, exploratory regression, ordinary least squares regression, geographic weighted regression, and land use analysis in a progressive manner to identify high and low farmer participation in the CTA program at the county level. The purpose of this paper is to explain and discuss that process and how the results were used to acquire a more comprehensive empirical data set, consisting of local interviews and mail survey data, for investigating the many factors that influence participation. Results had the added benefit of finding possible areas for NRCS outreach to underserved farmers.We contend this spatial modeling process uses readily available data sets and easily replicable techniques that contribute a relevant and robust method for soil and water conservation research in general and is highly applicable to other government and nongovernmental conservation programs that seek to identify communities for outreach.

AB Seabirds are vulnerable to incidental harm from human activities in the ocean, and knowledge of their seasonal distribution is required to assess risk and effectively inform marine conservation planning. Significant hydrocarbon discoveries and exploration licenses in the Labrador Sea underscore the need for quantitative information on seabird seasonal distribution and abundance, as this region is known to provide important habitat for seabirds year-round. We explore the utility of density surface modeling (DSM) to improve seabird information available for regional conservation and management decision making. We, (1) develop seasonal density surface models for seabirds in the Labrador Sea using data from vessel-based surveys (2006-2014: 13,783 linear km of surveys), (2) present measures of uncertainty in model predictions, (3) discuss how density surface models can inform conservation and management decision making, and 4) explore challenges and potential pitfalls associated with using these modeling procedures. Models predicted large areas of high seabird density in fall over continental shelf waters (max similar to 80 birds-km(-2)) driven largely by the southward migration of murres (Una app.) and dovekies (Alle alle) from Arctic breeding colonies. The continental shelf break was also highlighted as an important habitat feature, with predictions of high seabird densities particularly during summer (max similar to 70 birds-km(-2)). Notable concentrations of seabirds overlapped with several significant hydrocarbon discoveries on the continental shelf and large areas in the vicinity of the southern shelf break, which are in the early stages of exploration. Some, but not all, areas of high seabird density were within current Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (EBSA) boundaries. Building predictive spatial models required knowledge of Distance Sampling and GAMs, and significant investments of time and computational power-resource needs that are becoming more common in ecological modeling. Visualization of predictions and their uncertainty needed to be considered for appropriate interpretation by end users. Model uncertainty tended to be greater where survey effort was limited or where predictor covariates exceeded the range of those observed. Predictive spatial models proved useful in generating defensible estimates of seabird densities in many areas of interest to the oil and gas industry in the Labrador Sea, and will have continued use in marine risk assessments and spatial planning activities in the region and beyond.

AB The Tonle Sap is the largest wetland in South-east Asia and the heart of the largest inland fishery in the world. Its unique flood pulse system and annual flow reversal is a hotspot for biodiversity and productivity, as well as an essential habitat for many endangered fishes and birds. Despite predicted changes to the wetland's hydrology due to climate change and hydropower development in the Mekong, the consequent impacts on the fauna of the lake are poorly understood. A spatial modelling framework was developed to simulate the impact of potential scenarios of change using relationships between fauna and biophysical characteristics. Potential impacts on 61 animal species with documented nutritional, conservation or ecological value were examined. A large number of species rely on gallery forest to provide important habitats for their life history, yet this area is likely to be highly impacted by permanent inundation. There is a strong synchronicity between life histories and the flood pulse; consequently continued hydrological disruptions will have a significant impact on ecosystem dynamics, imposing further challenges to conservation. Protecting areas that may become suitable for gallery forests and shrublands under a modified flood regime will be crucial to management planning and the maintenance of a diverse and healthy ecosystem.

AB The survival of large carnivores is increasingly precarious due to extensive human development that causes the habitat loss and fragmentation. Habitat selection is influenced by anthropogenic as well as environmental factors, and understanding these relationships is important for conservation management. We assessed the environmental and anthropogenic variables that influence site use of clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa in Bhutan, estimated their population density, and used the results to predict the species' site use across Bhutan. We used a large camera-trap dataset from the national tiger survey to estimate for clouded leopards, for the first time in Bhutan, (1) population density using spatially explicit capture-recapture models and (2) site-use probability using occupancy models accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Population density was estimated at D = 0.40 (0.10 SD) and D maximum-likelihood=0.30 (0.12 SE) per 100km(2). Clouded leopard site use was positively associated with forest cover and distance to river while negatively associated with elevation. Mean site-use probability (from the Bayesian spatial model) was =0.448 (0.076 SD). When spatial autocorrelation was ignored, the probability of site use was overestimated, =0.826 (0.066 SD). Predictive mapping allowed us to identify important conservation areas and priority habitats to sustain the future of these elusive, ambassador felids and associated guilds. Multiple sites in the south, many of them outside of protected areas, were identified as habitats suitable for this species, adding evidence to conservation planning for clouded leopards in continental South Asia.

TI Refining Reproductive Parameters for Modelling Sustainability and
   Extinction in Hunted Primate Populations in the Amazon
SO PLOS ONE

AB Primates are frequently hunted in Amazonia. Assessing the sustainability of hunting is essential to conservation planning. The most-used sustainability model, the 'Production Model', and more recent spatial models, rely on basic reproductive parameters for accuracy. These parameters are often crudely estimated. To date, parameters used for the Amazon's most-hunted primate, the woolly monkey (Lagothrix spp.), come from captive populations in the 1960s, when captive births were rare. Furthermore, woolly monkeys have since been split into five species. We provide reproductive parameters calculated by examining the reproductive organs of female Poeppig's woolly monkeys (Lagothrix poeppigii), collected by hunters as part of their normal subsistence activity. Production was 0.48-0.54 young per female per year, and an interbirth interval of 22.3 to 25.2 months, similar to parameters from captive populations. However, breeding was seasonal, which imposes limits on the maximum reproductive rate attainable. We recommend the use of spatial models over the Production Model, since they are less sensitive to error in estimated reproductive rates. Further refinements to reproductive parameters are needed for most primate taxa. Methods like ours verify the suitability of captive reproductive rates for sustainability analysis and population modelling for populations under differing conditions of hunting pressure and seasonality. Without such research, population modelling is based largely on guesswork.

AB This study examines the application of unsupervised classification techniques in the mapping of forest vegetation, aiming to align vegetation cover with the Braun-Blanquet classification system through remote sensing. By leveraging Landsat 8 and 9 satellite imagery and advanced clustering algorithms, specifically the Weka X-Means, this research addresses the challenge of minimizing researcher subjectivity in vegetation mapping. The methodology incorporates a two-step clustering approach to accurately classify forest communities, utilizing a comprehensive set of vegetation indices to distinguish between different types of forest ecosystems. The validation of the classification model relied on a detailed analysis of over 17,000 relev & eacute;s from the "Flora" database, ensuring a high degree of accuracy in matching satellite-derived vegetation classes with field observations. The study's findings reveal the successful identification of 44 forest community types that was aggregated into seven classes of Braun-Blanquet classification system, demonstrating the efficacy of unsupervised classification in generating reliable vegetation maps. This work not only contributes to the advancement of remote sensing applications in ecological research, but also provides a valuable tool for natural resource management and conservation planning. The integration of unsupervised classification with the Braun-Blanquet system presents a novel approach to vegetation mapping, offering insights into ecological characteristics, and can be good starter point for sequestration potential of forest communities' assessment in the Republic of Tatarstan.

AB Mineral licks are faunal attractors, whose distribution determines the structure and composition of Amazonian landscapes and the way they are used by wildlife and traditional communities. Research on the distribution of mineral licks is scarce, limiting the possibility of using them in conservation beyond local scales. Using the species distribution modeling framework, we predicted the distribution of suitable conditions for mineral licks in the Northwest Amazon, compiling localities from academic and traditional sources and using environmental variables associated with geology, geomorphology, edaphology, topography, and hydrology. Best models, selected according to evaluation metrics incorporated in the ENMeval "R" package, showed to be robust and predict sectors with different areas, but similar distributions. Suitable areas covered up to 14.6% of the study area and confirmed the association of mineral licks with the drainage system. The erosive capacities of the rivers and their roles in terms of sediment deposition allowed the generation of ideal conditions for the expression of mineral licks in past and present riparian zones. Closeness to salt deposits and the seacoast was also important, giving information about the underground and aboveground mineral availability, crucial aspects for mineral lick formation. Considering the extension and distribution of our predictions, we proposed its use as input for other spatial modeling exercises, for example, as part of a complex resistance matrix to evaluate ecological connectivity or as criteria to prioritize sectors for restoration in the Colombian Amazon, where it is imperative to consolidate functional networks to prevent isolation between the Amazon and Andes regions.

The case study of Pitti Palace in Florence, Italy, is proposed, considering that its architectural complexity and cultural significance require innovative approaches to documentation and management. The "Pitti Data Model" is proposed as a tailored information system to organize and manage the data. It classifies spaces by adopting a hierarchical approach that supports detailed spatial analysis and reflects the historical and functional diversity of the site. The model links geometric data with thematic data such as material types, state of conservation, and historical names of spaces, providing a multi-dimensional understanding of the building. Based on Getty's Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), a controlled vocabulary was employed to ensure semantic consistency and interoperability. This semantic enrichment facilitates the integration of geometric data with broader heritage information systems. The paper presents, therefore, the integration in existing standards like INSPIRE, CityGML, and IndoorGML, thus providing a data model supporting efficient querying and visualization in a GeoDB that integrates spatial and non-spatial data, supporting collaborative and sustainable heritage management by enabling advanced analyses such as visitor flow optimization and conservation planning. This aligns with the concept of Heritage Digital Twins (HDT), which are interactive, evolving representations of cultural assets. HDTs support collaborative and sustainable heritage management by enabling stakeholders to access, analyze, and update information in real time.

AB The streaked homed lark (hereafter "lark"; Eremophila alpestris strigata) is a federally listed bird subspecies of the Pacific Northwest that occupies open landscapes with short vegetation and abundant bare ground. Across its breeding range, which has contracted dramatically, the lark relies primarily on human-modified habitats maintained in early successional states (e.g., agricultural fields, airfields, deposition islands). The focus of our study is the lower Columbia River where larks primarily occupy deposition islands created as a byproduct of shipping channel deepening (dredging) projects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has proactively adopted a shifting-habitat-mosaic management approach when placing dredge (sand) materials to maintain lark habitat throughout the project area. To help achieve their goal, we created a geospatial tool capable of quantifying and tracking habitat suitability for larks throughout the project area with satellite imagery. We created spatial models of lark breeding habitat by incorporating lark survey data, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, dredge-deposition maps, and surface-elevation models. We built candidate predictive models of lark breeding habitat after combining survey data (years 2016 and 2017), predictor variables, and logistic regression. In addition, we created a novel seral-stage predictor variable to identify young, mature, old, and unsuitable locations; critical information for lark conservation planning and dredge-disposal operational planning. We challenged probability models the year they were constructed (2016) and the following year (2017) with set-aside survey data. The best model contained terrain ruggedness, deposition age, vegetation greenness (e.g., lushness and density of vegetation) inside a 10-m cell, and heterogeneity in greenness within a 100-m radius. Verification accuracy ranged from 75 to 83% depending on the model tested and year. Importantly, the seral-stage variable allowed us to quantify and locate early, optimal, and late habitats. Model results will facilitate conservation planning decisions by informing real-time management decisions. Furthermore, they provide a foundation for application in other human-modified habitats across the species' range.

AB Context. The study of the spatial variation in abundance of wild populations and the identification of factors explaining the observed patterns are key both to understand aspects of basic ecology and the effects of human activities. This is usually difficult to evaluate for low-density and widely distributed species, such as the lesser rhea (Rhea pennata pennata), an endemic bird from South America. Recent advances in spatial modelling such as the density surface models (DSM) combine distance-sampling procedures with modelling techniques to produce maps of spatial variation in abundance, and its relationship with predictive variables.
   Aims. We aimed to analyse the spatial distribution and abundance of lesser rhea, and the variables that affect its abundance in Peninsula Valdes (PV) Argentine Patagonia.
   Methods. We conducted 338.4 km of ground surveys of lesser rheas in PV during the end of the Austral summer of 2015. Spatial models were constructed using DSM. Ecological and human-related variables were included in the models to account for variation in the abundance of animals at 4-km(2) spatial resolution.
   Key results. We estimated an overall density of 0.44 birds km(-2) (CV = 32%) for the prediction area of 3320 km(2). High values of normalised difference vegetation index, a correlate of plant productivity, were associated with increased numbers of lesser rheas. The location of ranch buildings, indicators of human presence, had a strong negative effect on lesser rheas, although their abundance increased at high sheep stocking rates.
   Conclusions. As reported by previous studies in different sites, the abundance of lesser rheas in our study area was low. The use of DSM allowed a detailed examination of the spatial variation, as well as the variables involved and the uncertainty of the prediction.
   Implications. The use of DSM techniques can be a useful tool for conservation planning and monitoring. Spatial, high-resolution data combined with knowledge on the factors affecting the number of animals are crucial to target specific conservation actions and monitor their results, and should allow government agencies to make better decisions concerning conservation-oriented management.

AB Cost data are crucial in conservation planning to identify more efficient and equitable land use options. However, many studies focus on just one cost type and neglect others, particularly those borne locally. We develop, for a high priority conservation area, spatial models of two local costs that arise from protected areas: foregone agricultural opportunities and increased wildlife damage. We then map these across the study area and compare them to the direct costs of reserve management, finding that local costs exceed management costs. Whilst benefits of conservation accrue to the global community, significant costs are borne by those living closest. Where livelihoods depend upon opportunities forgone or diminished by conservation intervention, outcomes are limited. Activities can be displaced (leakage); rules can be broken (intervention does not work); or the intervention forces a shift in livelihood profiles (potentially to the detriment of local peoples' welfare). These raise concerns for both conservation and development outcomes and timely consideration of local costs is vital in conservation planning tools and processes. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Introduction The allocation of limited resources to simultaneously protect biodiversity and provide ecosystem services (ESs) is a critical global challenge in achieving the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. One common strategy for this challenge is to expand existing protected areas (PAs), but the efficiency of different expansion methods for biodiversity and ESs remains unknown.Methods This study investigated two strategies, preserving existing PAs ("locking") versus reassessing their boundaries ("unlocking"), to evaluate their effectiveness in achieving biodiversity and ES targets. The study used Marxan, a spatial modeling tool, to assess the effectiveness of PAs expansion strategies on Hainan Island in China.Results and discussion The current PAs system, which encompasses 8.82% of the island, is inadequate for protecting the target levels of biodiversity and ES. We experimented with expanding the PAs to 15% using both strategies. The results revealed that, compared with the "unlocking" strategy, the "locking" strategy favored ES protection (66.49% vs 86.84%), but did so at the expense of biodiversity conservation. In contrast, the "unlocking" strategy required a larger area for expansion and led to increased habitat fragmentation compared wtih the "locking" approach. These findings underscore the need for a strategic approach to expanding PAs and balancing between biodiversity conservation and ES provision. This study offers valuable insights that could be used for broader applications in PAs management and biodiversity conservation planning.

AB Marine geomorphological maps are useful to understand seafloor structure for example in the context of ecological studies, resources management or conservation planning. Although techniques to build such maps are increasingly sophisticated, manual techniques are still largely used. Automated approaches are needed to get reproducible maps in a reasonable time. This work provides statistical learning approaches based framework to build automatically geomorphological maps. We used bathymetric data to build Digital Bathymetric Model (DBM) and compute terrain attributes characteristic of seafloor geomorphology. Then, we used clustering based algorithms to select automatically ground truth locations from a reference geomorphological map manually made. Finally a supervised classification model random forest based was used to build predictive models for seafloor geomorphology typologies. Subsequently we studied the effect of DBM resolution, sample size and sampling method of the ground truth locations, in the quality of map production via a series of simulations. Results showed that the proposed framework allowed to build efficiently relevant seafloor geomorphological maps. The best compromise between the sampling effort and the quality of the resulting maps was obtained with 100 m DBM resolution, 200 data points sample size and using a complexity-dependent sampling method and led to a map matching at 90% the reference one.

AB Freshwater ecosystems support biological communities with high species richness and conservation interest. However, these ecosystems are highly altered by human intervention and threatened worldwide, making them a priority in conservation planning and biodiversity monitoring. Bryophytes, including several conservation-interest taxa, are recognized indicators of ecological status in freshwaters. We aimed to develop a framework for designing monitoring networks to detect trends in aquatic and semi-aquatic bryophyte communities, prioritizing high-conservation interest communities in different contexts of human pressure (specifically, resulting from the intersection of two criteria: (i) protection status and (ii) presence of a potential impact area).
   The framework consists of three steps: (1) Spatial modelling of biodiversity; (2) Spatial conservation prioritization; and (3) Model-assisted monitoring network design. Community-level modelling was used to model the distribution of the main bryophyte assemblages in the study area. A conservation prioritization software was utilized to identify areas with high conservation value. The monitoring network was designed using stratified random sampling and unequal-probability sampling techniques to target high conservation value sites distributed across different contexts of human pressure.
   We have identified four distinct community types, each characterized both by a small group of common and dominant species, and by small group of rarer, conservation-interest species. This typification of four species assemblages occurring in the study area, also highlighted those with potentially higher conservation-interest. The most valuable areas for the conservation of aquatic and semi-aquatic bryophyte communities coincide with specific environmental zones: mountainous areas in Lusitania, large watercourses in the Mediterranean North and some locations in the Mediterranean Mountains. Finally, we obtained a potential monitoring network consisting of 64 monitoring points, unequally distributed across different contexts of human pressure, privileging locations with higher conservation value.
   The framework presented here illustrates the potential of combining biodiversity modelling, spatial conservation prioritization and monitoring design in the development of monitoring networks. Namely, this framework allowed us to counter data deficiencies, to identify high priority areas to monitor and to design a monitoring network considering different scenarios of human pressure at a regional scale.
   This framework can also be valuable for conservation efforts as an approach to monitoring conservation-interest biodiversity features in anthropogenically modified riverscapes, which present different degrees of human pressure and the cumulative effects of these different impact elements. Moreover, this approach allows for the comprehensive monitoring of biodiversity values important for management at the national and regional levels. In addition, this framework is one of the first efforts in the development of monitoring networks that target aquatic and semi-aquatic bryophyte communities, a long-neglected plant group of high ecological and conservation importance in freshwater ecosystems.

AB The dynamics of land use/land cover (LU/LC) is a manifestation of the cyclic correlation among the kind and magnitude of causes, impacts, responses and resulting ecological processes of the ecosystem. Thus, the holistic understanding of the complex mechanisms that control LU/LC requires synergetic adoption of measurement approaches, addressing issues, and identifying drivers of change and state of art technologies for mitigation measures. As the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the LU/LC increases, its impact on biodiversity becomes even more difficult to anticipate. Thus, in order to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of change in landscape and its relationship to biodiversity, it is necessary to reliably identify and quantify the indicators of change. In addition, it is also important to have better understanding of the technologies and techniques that serve as complimentary tool for land mitigation and conservation planning. Against this background, the chapter aims to synthesize LU/LC studies worldwide and their impacts on biodiversity. This chapter explores identification and analysis of key natural, socio-economic and regulatory drivers for LU/LC. Finally, it attempts to collate some LU/LC studies involving usage of geospatial tools, such as satellite remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and integrative tools, besides conventional approaches that could assist decision makers, land managers, stakeholders and researchers in better management and formulation of conservation strategies based on scientific grounds.

AB Integrating cultural and natural resources for large landscape conservation remains an applied challenge for landscape planners and resource managers across North America. When resources are considered at a regional scale, developing shared priorities, definitions, and metrics is an essential but complex process for successful conservation partnerships. Strategies exist for designing regional conservation models for natural resources, but methods for cultural resource conservation planning often remain focused on individual sites and buildings. Here, we build on our previous work with the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives to advance frameworks and spatial models for regionally integrated natural and cultural resource conservation design and planning. Specifically, we present the results of our survey of cultural resource specialists in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States to better understand how cultural resources are defined, classified, and valued by this group. Methods from applied cognitive anthropology are useful for uncovering cultural consensus and more marginalized perspectives around resource management priorities, offering a clear pathway for integrating cultural and natural resource conservation. We conclude by restating a call for a National GAP-like research program for cultural resources that integrates diverse cultural practices, perspectives, histories, and values of communities for designing future conservation priorities.

AB Measures of population pressure, referring in general to the stress upon the environment by human consumption of resources, are imperative for environmental sustainability studies and management. Development based on resource consumption is the predominant factor of population pressure. This paper presents a spatial model of population pressure by linking consumption associated with regional urbanism and ecosystem services. Maps representing relative geographic degree and extent of natural resource consumption and degree and extent of impacts on surrounding areas are new, and this research represents the theoretical research toward this goal. With development, such maps offer a visualization tool for planners of various services, amenities for people, and conservation planning for ecologist. Urbanization is commonly generalized by census numbers or impervious surface area. The potential geographical extent of urbanism encompasses the environmental resources of the surrounding region that sustain cities. This extent is interpolated using kriging of a variable based on population wealth data from the U.S. Census Bureau. When overlayed with land-use/land-cover data, the results indicate that the greatest estimates of population pressure fall within mixed forest areas. Mixed forest areas result from the spread of cedar woods in previously disturbed areas where further disturbance is then suppressed. Low density areas, such as suburbanization and abandoned farmland are characteristic of mixed forest areas.

AB Forests will be critical to mitigate the effects of climate and global changes. Therefore, knowledge on the drivers of forest area changes are important. Although the drivers of deforestation are well known, drivers of afforestation are almost unexplored. Moreover, protected areas (PAs) effectively decrease deforestation, but other types of area-based conservation measures exist. Among these, sacred natural sites (SNS) deliver positive conservation outcomes while making up an extensive "shadow network" of conservation. However, little is known on the capacity of SNS to regulate land-use changes. Here, we explored the role of SNS and PAs as drivers of forest loss and forest gain in Italy between 1936 and 2018. We performed a descriptive analysis and modeled forest gain and forest loss by means of spatial binomial generalized linear models with residual autocovariates. The main drivers of forest area changes were geographical position and elevation, nonetheless SNS and PAs significantly decreased forest loss and increased forest gain. Although the negative relationship between SNS and forest loss is a desirable outcome, the positive relationship with forest gain is concerning because it could point to abandonment of cultural landscapes with consequent loss of open habitats. We suggest a legal recognition of SNS and an active ecological monitoring and planning to help maintain their positive role in biodiversity conservation. As a novel conservation planning approach, SNS can be used as stepping stones between PAs increasing connectivity and also to conserve small habitat patches threatened by human activities.

AB The provision of many ecosystem services depends on the spatial pattern of land use across multiple landowners. Even holding land use constant, ecosystem service provision may change through time due to climate change. This paper develops an auction mechanism that implements an optimal solution for providing ecosystem services through time with multiple landowners who have private information about the net benefits of alternative uses of their land. Under the auction, each landowner has a dominant strategy to truthfully reveal their private information. With this information a regulator can then implement the optimal landscape pattern, which maximizes the present value of net benefits derived from the landscape, following the rules of the auction mechanism. The auction can be designed as a subsidy auction that pays landowners to conserve or a tax auction where landowners pay for the right to develop. Our mechanism optimizes social adaptation of ecosystem management to climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The loss, alteration and fragmentation of faunal habitat affects the ability of species to persist in the landscape. Effective management and reconstruction of habitat to enhance species persistence needs to be informed by organism-centric approaches to evaluating alternative habitat scenarios. Such approaches need to be founded on sound ecological theory, be capable of integrating knowledge of dynamic ecological processes with data on the distribution and quality of habitat in spatially complex landscapes, and yet be simple and efficient enough for broad application.
   We describe a new methodology - rapid evaluation of metapopulation persistence (REMP) - that integrates a cost-benefit approach to measuring landscape connectivity, using continuously variable (i.e. raster) habitat surfaces, with existing analytical techniques for determining the metapopulation capacity of a given landscape and for predicting occupancy patterns within this landscape. By adapting these existing techniques to work with raster data structures REMP is particularly well-suited to analysis of highly variegated landscapes. REMP produces results rapidly using best-available habitat suitability mapping and a limited set of parameters defining species movement abilities and habitat area requirements. These parameters can be estimated from expert knowledge when no empirical data are available. The approach has been successfully integrated into landscape scenario development and evaluation systems, supporting conservation planning for native fauna in NSW, Australia. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1. To develop a conservation management plan for a species, knowledge of its distribution and spatial arrangement of preferred habitat is essential. This is a difficult task, especially when the species of concern is in low abundance. In south-western Victoria, Australia, populations of the rare rufous bristlebird Dasyornis broadbenti are threatened by fragmentation of suitable habitat. In order to improve the conservation status of this species, critical habitat requirements must be identified and a system of corridors must be established to link known populations. A predictive spatial model of rufous bristlebird habitat was developed in order to identify critical areas requiring preservation, such as corridors for dispersal.
   2. Habitat models generated using generalized linear modelling techniques can assist in delineating the specific habitat requirements of a species. Coupled with geographic information system (GIS) technology, these models can be extrapolated to produce maps displaying the spatial configuration of suitable habitat.
   3. Models were generated using logistic regression, with bristlebird presence or absence as the dependent variable and landscape variables, extracted from both GIS data layers and multispectral digital imagery, as the predictors. A multimodel inference approach based on Akaike's information criterion was used and the resulting model was applied in a GIS to extrapolate predicted likelihood of occurrence across the entire area of concern. The predictive performance of the selected model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) technique. A hierarchical partitioning protocol was used to identify the predictor variables most likely to influence variation in the dependent variable. Probability of species presence was used as an index of habitat suitability.
   4. Negative associations between rufous bristlebird presence and increasing elevation, 'distance to creek', 'distance to coast' and sun index were evident, suggesting a preference for areas relatively low in altitude, in close proximity to the coastal fringe and drainage lines, and receiving less direct sunlight. A positive association with increasing habitat complexity also suggested that this species prefers areas containing high vertical density of vegetation.
   5. The predictive performance of the selected model was shown to be high (area under the curve 0.97), indicating a good fit of the model to the data. Hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that all the variables considered had significant independent contributions towards explaining the variation in the dependent variable. The proportion of the total study area that was predicted as suitable habitat for the rufous bristlebird (using probability of occurrence at a greater than or equal to 0.5 level) was 16%.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The spatial model clearly delineated areas predicted as highly suitable rufous bristlebird habitat, with evidence of potential corridors linking coastal and inland populations via gullies. Conservation of this species will depend on management actions that protect the critical habitats identified in the model. A multiscale approach to the modelling process is recommended whereby a spatially explicit model is first generated using landscape variables extracted from a GIS, and a second model at site level is developed using fine-scale habitat variables measured on the ground. Where there are constraints on the time and cost involved in measuring finer scale variables, the first step alone can be used for conservation planning.

AB Predation on livestock is one of the main factors that cause the felids hunting, in particular for puma and jaguar this conflict with humans is severe. Most studies have assessed the predation impacts on livestock production; however there is a spatial pattern in attacks occurrence that is feasible to analyze from ecological niche modeling. The objective of this research was to generate a risk model of livestock predation by puma and jaguar in Mexico based on environmental and livestock management variables, which allows identification of zones of risk in order to define mitigation strategies at national level. We produced a geographic ensemble model of risk of predation from three algorithms for jaguar and five for puma. The variables most positively related with predation risk by jaguar were vegetative cover percentage, percentage of free grazing animals, and altitude, whereas arid vegetation has a negative influence on predation risk. In the case of puma the variables with highest contribution were livestock density, which negatively influences on the predation risk, in addition to forest and altitude, both with a positive relation. The ensemble models are an accurate approach to delineating the zones of predation risk by felids; however at a regional scale the environmental characteristics that favor predation may be different. It is recommended that researchers carry out studies for each biogeographic province that facilitate the identification of specific patterns and the definition of mitigation strategies most suitable for each one.

AB Understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes that have shaped current patterns of biodiversity is crucial in the planning and implementation of broad scale conservation management. The temporal and spatial pattern of diversity across a landscape can help identify areas that have acted as climatically stable refugia historically, or do so currently. This has important implications for conservation efforts that try to maximise the evolutionary potential of species, as well as maintaining existing biodiversity. Northern Australia has recently reported catastrophic species decline, particularly in mammals, due to a series of threats. Here we apply an integrative approach utilising molecular analyses and spatial modelling to determine whether disjunct populations of a potentially rare, endemic mammal, the scaly-tailed possum (Wyulda squamicaudata) exhibit differentiation associated with biogeographic barriers or a recent decline. Significant but low genetic differentiation between the east and west Kimberley populations was detected. Principal component analyses indicate potential climatic niche differences that could support recent localised adaptations. Climatic reconstructions back to the last glacial maximum (LGM) indicate areas of suitable habitat have substantially shifted through time for W. squamicaudata and suggest multiple areas of refugia across the Kimberley since the LGM. Further comparative research is required to establish a biogeographical framework that will assist in our understanding of processes that have shaped biodiversity in northern Australia and assist in conservation planning.

AB Agent-based models (ABMs) are increasingly recognized as valuable tools in applied ecology for simulating species behavior, ecological interactions, and responses to management. However, their adoption in conservation and policy contexts has been limited by a reliance on simplified representations and a lack of integration with empirical data. This paper presents a structured, data-informed framework for developing applied ABMs using high-resolution spatial, behavioral, and environmental datasets. By incorporating telemetry data, remote sensing products, and site-level ecological monitoring, the framework enables realistic simulations of ecological systems that can be used to virtually test management strategies and policy interventions. These models support real-time scenario testing, guide field data collection by identifying knowledge gaps, and facilitate transparent communication with stakeholders. We demonstrate the utility of this framework using a published case study on badger movement and bovine tuberculosis risk in a disturbance-driven landscape, showing how it reveals emergent behavioral patterns with implications for disease management. By formalizing a repeatable protocol for model development, validation, and stakeholder engagement, this research enhances the accessibility and applicability of ABMs in conservation planning, biodiversity monitoring, and human-wildlife conflict mitigation. The framework supports evidence-based decision-making while promoting transparency, adaptability, and cross-sector collaboration.

AB Mangrove forests play a vital role in climate regulation, carbon storage, and biodiversity conservation, yet their capacity to meet ecological demands remains poorly quantified. The Sundarbans, the world's largest contiguous mangrove ecosystem, faces escalating environmental pressures that threaten its biocapacity-the ability of ecosystems to provide renewable resources and absorb human-generated waste. This study evaluates biocapacity and ecological deficit/reserve at local, national, and global scales by integrating key environmental drivers, including salinity, stand structure, and climate variables. Data were collected from 54 georeferenced plots covering 54 management compartments, and analyses were conducted at plot-level, compartment-level, and broader regional scales. Results reveal significant spatial variability, with the oligohaline zone supporting the largest ecological reserve (1.87 +/- 0.164 gha/person), followed by the mesohaline (1.13 +/- 0.167 gha/person), whereas polyhaline regions exhibit the lowest reserve (0.48 +/- 0.1 gha/person). Globally, polyhaline zones face severe ecological deficits (-1.11 +/- 0.1 gha/person), highlighting their vulnerability to environmental stressors. Biocapacity correlates with salinity (r = -0.39), temperature (r = -0.42), precipitation (r = 0.32), and elevation (r = 0.35), while structural attributes such as tree height (r = 0.33) and wood density (r = 0.34) further shape ecosystem capacity. To strengthen environmental management, biocapacity assessments should be integrated into policy and conservation planning frameworks for sustainable resource allocation. As climate change alters temperature and salinity regimes, proactive mitigation strategies, ecosystem-based adaptation, and sustainable management practices are essential for maintaining ecological balance, reducing biodiversity loss, and ensuring the stability of mangrove ecosystem services.

AB Regional conservation planning increasingly draws on habitat suitability models to support decisions regarding land allocation and management. Nevertheless, statistical techniques commonly used for developing such models may give misleading results because they fail to account for 3 factors common in data sets of species distribution: spatial autocorrelation, the large number of sites where the species is absent (zero inflation), and uneven survey effort. We used spatial autoregressive models fit with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to assess the relationship between older coniferous forest and the abundance of Northern Spotted Owl nest and activity sites throughout the species' range. The spatial random-effect term incorporated in the autoregressive models successfully accounted for zero inflation and reduced the effect of survey bias on estimates of species-habitat associations. Our results support the hypothesis that the relationship between owl distribution and older forest varies with latitude. A quadratic relationship between owl abundance and older forest was evident in the southern portion of the range, and a pseudothreshold relationship was evident in the northern portion of the range. Our results suggest that proposed changes to the network of owl habitat reserves would reduce the proportion of the population protected by up to one-third, and that proposed guidelines for forest management within reserves underestimate the proportion of older forest associated with maximum owl abundance and inappropriately generalize threshold relationships among subregions. Bayesian spatial models can greatly enhance the utility of habitat analysis for conservation planning because they add the statistical flexibility necessary for analyzing regional survey data while retaining the interpretability of simpler models.

AB With freshwater diversity facing unprecedented global decline driven by human activities, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework's 30 x 30 initiative aims to protect 30 % of land and water by 2030. However, effective conservation requires understanding the spatial distribution of biodiversity and ensuring protected areas align with biodiversity hotspots. We developed spatial models of taxonomic and functional diversity of stream fishes across West Virginia using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation with Stochastic Partial Differential Equations. We analyzed 505 sampling sites to map species richness, functional richness, and functional divergence, and assessed their alignment with protected areas. Elevation emerged as a consistent driver across all diversity metrics, with higher diversity in lowland streams. Precipitation positively influenced functional divergence, while species richness was surprisingly higher in areas with greater land degradation, likely reflecting historical human settlement in biodiversity-rich areas. Current protected areas of West Virginia (similar to 17.12 % of total area) predominantly encompass regions of low taxonomic and functional diversity, with less than 5 % of taxonomic diversity hotspots and less than 10 % of functional diversity hotspots under protection. The mismatch between diversity patterns and protection status creates significant conservation challenges, as many biodiverse streams now flow through urbanized or industrialized areas. Our findings highlight the need for conservation strategies that target not only traditional wild areas but also urban and degraded waterways supporting diverse fish assemblages. By utilizing routine agency surveys and publicly available databases, our approach offers a replicable framework that can inform conservation planning and management across different regions, supporting global goals for freshwater ecosystem protection.

AB Robust design of Marine Protected Areas in ocean environments is often challenging due to inadequate knowledge of biodiversity patterns, reflecting difficulties in the prediction of species distributions from sampling data that are often sparse or inadequate. Models that combine species and environmental data, such as Gradient Forests (GF), provide one analytical approach to this problem, efficiently combining available information to produce spatial models of species turnover throughout an area of interest. Spatial estimates of species turnover can then be classified to estimate spatial patterns in species composition; however, the performance of GF-based classifications within a conservation planning context has not previously been evaluated. Here we assess the utility for conservation planning (using the software Zonation) of a GF-based hierarchical classification that summarises spatial patterns in demersal fish composition in the oceans around New Zealand. Progressively more complex Zonation analyses assessed the effects of (i) varying the number of classification groups, (ii) adding information describing species turnover, and (iii) adding information describing spatial variation in demersal fish species richness. The best-performing GF-based conservation ranking used layers describing the distributions of 30 classification groups, demersal fish species turnover between these groups, and species richness. Conservation outcomes from this ranking were only marginally less efficient than those from a more conventional ranking that used 217 individual species distribution layers (7% less efficient). This indicates that GF-based classifications may provide a practical alternative for marine conservation planning. Additional advantages arise from the greater ease with which a single classification layer summarising complex biodiversity patterns can facilitate decision-making in participatory stakeholder processes.

AB Precise measures of population abundance and trend are needed for species conservation; these are most difficult to obtain for rare and rapidly changing populations. We compare uncertainty in densities estimated from spatio-temporal models with that from standard design-based methods. Spatio-temporal models allow us to target priority areas where, and at times when, a population may most benefit. Generalised additive models were fitted to a 31-year time series of point-transect surveys of an endangered Hawaiian forest bird, the Hawai'i 'akepaLoxops coccineus. This allowed us to estimate bird densities over space and time. We used two methods to quantify uncertainty in density estimates from the spatio-temporal model: the delta method (which assumes independence between detection and distribution parameters) and a variance propagation method. With the delta method we observed a 52% decrease in the width of the design-based 95% confidence interval (CI), while we observed a 37% decrease in CI width when propagating the variance. We mapped bird densities as they changed across space and time, allowing managers to evaluate management actions. Integrating detection function modelling with spatio-temporal modelling exploits survey data more efficiently by producing finer-grained abundance estimates than are possible with design-based methods as well as producing more precise abundance estimates. Model-based approaches require switching from making assumptions about the survey design to assumptions about bird distribution. Such a switch warrants consideration. In this case the model-based approach benefits conservation planning through improved management efficiency and reduced costs by taking into account both spatial shifts and temporal changes in population abundance and distribution.

AB Wetlands provide vital ecological and socioeconomic services but face escalating pressures worldwide. This study undertakes an integrated spatiotemporal assessment of the multifaceted vulnerabilities shaping Khinjhir Lake, an ecologically significant wetland ecosystem in Pakistan, using advanced geospatial and machine learning techniques. Multi-temporal optical remote sensing data from 2000 to 2020 was analyzed through spectral water indices, land cover classification, change detection and risk mapping to examine moisture variability, land cover modifications, area changes and proximity-based threats over two decades. The random forest algorithm attained the highest accuracy (89.5%) for land cover classification based on rigorous k-fold cross-validation, with a training accuracy of 91.2% and a testing accuracy of 87.3%. This demonstrates the model's effectiveness and robustness for wetland vulnerability modeling in the study area, showing 11% shrinkage in open water bodies since 2000. Inventory risk zoning revealed 30% of present-day wetland areas under moderate to high vulnerability. The cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov) model predicted continued long-term declines driven by swelling anthropogenic pressures like the 29 million population growth surrounding Khinjhir Lake. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating satellite data analytics, machine learning algorithms and spatial modeling to generate actionable insights into wetland vulnerability to guide conservation planning. The findings provide a robust baseline to inform policies aimed at ensuring the health and sustainable management and conservation of Khinjhir Lake wetlands in the face of escalating human and climatic pressures that threaten the ecological health and functioning of these vital ecosystems.

AB Despite the large number of species distribution modelling (SDM) applications driven by tracking data, individual information is most of the time neglected and traditional SDM approaches commonly focus on predicting the potential distribution at the species or population-level. By running classical SDMs (population approach) with mixed models including a random factor to account for the variability attributable to individual (individual approach), we propose an innovative five-steps framework to predict the potential and individual-level distributions of mobile species using GPS data collected from green turtles. Pseudo-absences were randomly generated following an environmentally-stratified procedure. A negative exponential dispersal kernel was incorporated into the individual model to account for spatial fidelity, while five environmental variables derived from high-resolution Lidar and hyperspectral data were used as predictors of the species distribution in generalized linear models. Both approaches showed a strong predictive power (mean: AUC > 0.93, CBI > 0.88) and goodness-of-fit (0.6 < adjusted R-2 < 0.9), but differed geographically with favorable habitats restricted around the tagging locations for the individual approach whereas favorable habitats from the population approach were more widespread. Our innovative way to combine predictions from both approaches into a single map provides a unique scientific baseline to support conservation planning and management of many taxa. Our framework is easy to implement and brings new opportunities to exploit existing tracking dataset, while addressing key ecological questions such as inter-individual plasticity and social interactions.

AB Biodiversity is a portmanteau word to indicate the variety of life at all levels from genes to ecosystems, but it is often simplistically equated to species richness; the word ecodiversity has thus been coined to address habitat variety. Biodiversity represents the core of the natural capital, and as such needs to be quantified and followed over time. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a major tool for biodiversity conservation at sea. Monitoring of both species and habitat diversity in MPAs is therefore mandatory and must include both inventory and periodic surveillance activities. In the case of inventories, the ideal would be to census all species and all habitats, but while the latter goal can be within reach, the former seems unattainable. Species inventory should be commeasured to investigation effort, while habitat inventory should be based on mapping. Both inventories may profit from suitability spatial modelling. Periodic surveillance actions should privilege conspicuous species and priority habitats. Efficient descriptor taxa and ecological indices are recommended to evaluate environmental status. While it seems obvious that surveillance activities should be carried out with regular recurrence, diachronic inventories and mapping are rarely carried out. Time series are of prime importance to detect marine ecosystem change even in the absence of direct human impacts.

AB Effective marine conservation and management require ecological monitoring in the form of intensive real-time data collection over large spatial scales. The combined use of fixed platforms (e.g., cabled observatories) and research vessels with platforms of different levels of teleoperated autonomy (e.g., remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can contribute to the acquisition of large multiparametric biological and environmental data. If those data are spatially combined, sufficient spatial coverage can be achieved for ecological monitoring. A digital twin of the ocean (DTO) approach can then be used as a virtual representation of that monitored space, enabling multiparametric analyses of environmental patterns and processes affecting biodiversity and species distributions, as well as socioeconomic activities. Here, we propose a general architecture for a DTO centred on real-time data collection from local networks on fixed and mobile platforms, such as the physical twin observers (PTO), which is synergistically merged with platforms operating at large geographic scales. We describe a roadmap to achieve this DTO via 4 key steps: (1) acquisition of in situ data with a robotic network of platforms; (2) the application of AI in image processing for extracting biological data; (3) big data management with data bubbles; and (4) development of the resulting DTO framework for providing ecosystem monitoring via the computation of ecological indicators and socioecological modelling.

AB Increasing anthropogenic pressure on marine ecosystems from fishing, pollution, climate change, and other sources is a big concern in marine conservation. Scientists have thus developed spatial models to map cumulative human impacts on marine ecosystems. However, these models are based on many assumptions and incorporate data that suffer from substantial incompleteness and inaccuracies. Rather than using a single model, we used Monte Carlo simulations to identify which parts of the oceans are subject to the most and least impact from anthropogenic stressors under 7 simulated sources of uncertainty (factors: e.g., missing stressor data and assuming linear ecosystem responses to stress). Most maps agreed that high-impact areas were located in the Northeast Atlantic, the eastern Mediterranean, the Caribbean, the continental shelf off northern West Africa, offshore parts of the tropical Atlantic, the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar, parts of East and Southeast Asia, parts of the northwestern Pacific, and many coastal waters. Large low-impact areas were located off Antarctica, in the central Pacific, and in the southern Atlantic. Uncertainty in the broad-scale spatial distribution of modeled human impact was caused by the aggregate effects of several factors, rather than being attributable to a single dominant source. In spite of the identified uncertainty in human-impact maps, they can-at broad spatial scales and in combination with other environmental and socioeconomic information-point to priority areas for research and management.

AB Spatial modelling approaches are increasingly being used to direct forest management and conservation planning at the landscape scale. A popular approach is the use of buffer-radius methods, which create buffers around distinct forest habitat patches to assess habitat connectivity within anthropogenic landscapes. However, the effectiveness and sensitivity of such methods have rarely been evaluated. In this study, Euclidean and least-cost buffer-radius approaches were used to predict functional ecological networks within the wooded landscape of the Isle of Wight (UK). To parameterize the models, a combination of empirical evidence and expert knowledge was used relating to the dispersal ability of a model species, the wood cricket (Nemobius sylvestris Bosc.). Three scenarios were developed to assess the influence of increasing the amount of spatial and species-specific input data on the model outcomes. This revealed that the level of habitat fragmentation for the model species is likely to be underestimated when few empirical data are available. Furthermore, the least-cost buffer approach outperformed simple Euclidean buffer in predicting presence and absence for the model species. Sensitivity analyses on model performance revealed high sensitivity of the models to variation in buffer distance (i.e. maximum dispersal distance) and permeability of common landscape features such as roads, watercourses, grassland and semi-natural habitat. This indicates that when data are lacking with which to parameterize buffer-radius models, the model outcomes need to be interpreted with caution. This study also showed that if sufficient empirical data are available, least-cost buffer approaches have the potential to be a valuable tool to assist forest managers in making informed decisions. However, least-cost approaches should always be used as an indicative rather than prescriptive management tool to support forest landscape conservation and planning.

AB Natural habitats in urban areas provide benefits for both humans and biodiversity. However, to achieve biodiversity gains, we require new techniques to determine habitat suitability and ecological connectivity that will inform urban planning and development. Using an example of an urban population of water voles Arvicola amphibius, we developed a habitat suitability model and a resistance-surface-based model of landscape connectivity to identify potential connectivity between areas of suitable habitat. We then updated the environmental variables according to new urban development plans and used our models to generate spatially explicit predictions of both habitat suitability and connectivity. To make models accessible to urban and conservation planners, we developed an interactive mapping tool that provided users with a graphical user interface (GUI) to inform conservation planning for this species. The model found that habitat suitability for water voles was related to the proportion and distance from key environmental variables, such as built-up areas and urban green spaces, while the connectivity model identified important corridors connecting areas of potential distribution for this species. Future development plans altered the potential spatial distribution of the water vole population, reducing the extent of suitable habitat in some core areas. The interactive mapping tool made available suitable habitat and connectivity maps for conservation managers to assess new planning applications and for the development of a conservation action plan for water voles. Synthesis and applications. We believe this approach provides a framework for future development of nature conservation tools that can be used by planners to inform ecological decision-making, increase biodiversity and reduce human-wildlife conflict in urban environments.

AB Human-induced habitat loss and fragmentation threaten biodiversity in the Eastern Himalayas, a crucial part of the Indo-Myanmar biodiversity hotspot. This study examines the distribution of 10 mammal species in Arunachal Pradesh using a multi-scale ensemble modeling approach, integrating Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), and MaxEnt to assess habitat suitability. By analyzing 57 environmental predictor variables across multiple spatial scales, we found that elevation is a key determinant for carnivores such as the dhole and the Asiatic golden cat, while herbivores like the northern red muntjac and the mainland serow prefer broadleaf forests. Species distributions showed distinct patterns, with most carnivores concentrated in the south, except for the widely distributed yellow-throated marten. Dhole and leopard cat preferred elevated broadleaf forests, while the Asiatic golden cat favored mixed forests. Herbivores like the northern red muntjac and mainland serow were found at higher elevations, whereas the Indian wild pig preferred grasslands and degraded habitats near human settlements. While protected areas (PAs) exhibited higher species richness, significant suitable habitats also exist outside these regions, underscoring the need for landscape-level conservation strategies. Precipitation seasonality and human population density emerged as significant predictors, highlighting the influence of climatic and anthropogenic factors on habitat suitability. Our findings emphasize the necessity of conserving large, connected landscapes to mitigate human-induced pressures and climate change impacts on these species. By combining spatial modeling with ecological insights, this study provides a framework for prioritizing conservation efforts. Future research should expand data collection across broader temporal and geographic scales and incorporate climate change projections to anticipate species distribution shifts. These findings are critical for guiding effective conservation planning and habitat management in this ecologically rich yet vulnerable region.

AB This research integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with geostatistical techniques and a Geographic Information System (GIS) to model erosion potential for soil conservation planning in Quercus suber agrosilvopastoral woodlands in the Algarve region of southern Portugal. Graphical interpretation Of the RUSLE parameters was performed using ordinary kriging. Semi-variograms were produced for each parameter. The maps resulting from the interpolation techniques were introduced in a GIS and their values reclassified. After that, spatial modelling was used to develop the final overlay map from all the information of the analyzed soil properties and RUSLE parameters, simulating "a potential soil erosion map." Hydraulic conductivity and the soil erodibility K factor with a nugget-to-sill ratio of 57% and 67%, respectively, showed the weakest spatial dependence, whereas organic matter demonstrated the strongest (31%). The maps created demonstrate the existence of a heavily textured area in the southern part of the site that could affect erosion and vegetation management techniques. Hydraulic conductivity was higher than 6cm/h in the northeastern part of the experimental area. The correlation between the spatially interpolated and observed values during the semi-variogram cross-validation, using the data set for method development, was high (r(2) > 0.81). The northwestern area was the most adequate for annual fodder cultivation. The most degraded and less suitable areas were in the southern part, with 108 t/ha potential erosion. Site-specific management methods could improve productivity and decrease the risk of erosion. The present research shows that geostatistics and GIS are useful tools for sustainable management Of extensive agrosilvopastoral areas.

AB Spatial relationships between distribution patterns of many species and vegetated habitats over multiple scales have been used in terrestrial ecosystems to help identify and map important areas for conservation and management. This approach is not widely used in characterizing habitat use of nekton species in estuaries, but it has great potential because these systems contain fairly discrete vegetated habitat types, and the distribution of nekton species can be influenced by the spatial arrangement of habitat. We examined the spatial relationships between estuarine habitats and nekton species to help map estuarine nekton communities for use in conservation planning. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), we measured area (m(2)) and edge density (m km(-2)) of estuarine habitats over multiple scales in Charlotte Harbor, Florida (USA). We used redundancy analysis (RDA) to examine spatial patterns of nekton community composition, habitat, and local habitat characteristics. RDA revealed that spatial patterns in nekton community composition were most highly correlated with distance from the nearest pass to the Gulf of Mexico (r = -0.97) and with salinity (r = 0.94) and area of continuous seagrass habitat (r = 0.91). We used GIS maps of 2 variables (distance from the nearest pass and area of continuous seagrass habitat) to model spatial patterns in nekton community composition and the distribution of several juveniles of fishery species (red drum Sciaenops ocellatus, gray snapper Lutjanus griseus, lane snapper L. synagris, sand seatrout Cynoscion arenarius, and spotted seatrout C. nebulosus). The results suggest that incorporating measures of habitat area (over multiple scales) and spatial position into spatial models of nekton distribution is useful in conservation and management planning.

AB Practical decision making in spatially distributed environmental assessment and management is increasingly based on environmental process models linked to geographical information systems. Powerful personal computers and Internet-accessible assessment tools are providing much greater public access to, and use of, environmental models and geo-spatial data. However traditional process models, such as the water erosion prediction project (WEPP), were not typically developed with a flexible graphical user interface (GUI) for applications across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, utilizing readily available geo-spatial data of highly variable precision and accuracy, and communicating with a diverse spectrum of users with different levels of expertise. As the development of the geo-spatial interface for WEPP (GeoWEPP) demonstrates, the GUI plays a key role in facilitating effective communication between the tool developer and user about data and model scales. The GeoWEPP approach illustrates that it is critical to develop a scientific and functional framework for the design, implementation, and use of such geo-spatial model assessment tools. The way that GeoWEPP was developed and implemented suggests a framework and scaling theory leading to a practical approach for developing geo-spatial interfaces for process models. GeoWEPP accounts for fundamental water erosion processes, model, and users needs, but most important it also matches realistic data availability and environmental settings by enabling even non-GIS-literate users to assemble the available geo-spatial data quickly to start soil and water conservation planning. In general, it is potential users' spatial and temporal scales of interest, and scales of readily available data, that should drive model design or selection, as opposed to using or designing the most sophisticated process model as the starting point and then determining data needs and result scales.

AB Aim The management and restoration of ecological processes mediated by biotic interactions is now broadly advocated and may be achieved by targeting restoration towards key agents. Although theoretically examined, a practical approach to incorporating the physiology and energetics of insects into restoration planning is poorly articulated. I aimed to provide a case study using the thermal biology and energetics of beetles to identify the distribution of habitat suitability in a large restoration landscape. Location South-west Western Australia. Methods I modelled the thermal performance of metabolic rates of thirteenPhyllococerus purpurascens,and twentyColpochila"species 2," measured repeatedly at seven temperatures between five and 40 degrees C using flow-through respirometry. Thermal constraints were used to inform a species distribution model of each species at extremely high spatiotemporal resolution, projecting the physiological state of each species for every hour at 5 '' resolution across a 152-km(2)restoration landscape in south-western Australia to estimate the habitat suitability for beetles. Results Both species' metabolic rates increased exponentially to a critical point, followed by rapid decline, but the thermal tolerance thresholds were different for each species. Both had strikingly high-thermal tolerance relative to their nocturnal habits and local climatic conditions. The models of beetle prevalence estimated both species to be active and able to access the entire project area for all of the austral spring, summer and autumn. Main conclusions The results reported here suggest ubiquitous habitat suitability for flower beetles in disturbed landscapes. Incorporation of similar mechanistic models for other species at high resolution offers potential insight into habitat suitability for a broad range of ectotherms.

AB Soil erosion by water has accelerated over recent decades due to non-sustainable land use practices resulting in substantial land degradation processes. Spatially explicit information on soil erosion is critical for the development and implementation of appropriate Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) measures. The objectives of this study were to estimate the magnitude of soil loss rate, assess the change of erosion risk, and elucidate their implication for SWC planning in the Gobele Watershed, East Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia. Applying remote sensing data, the study first derived the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model parameters in an ArcGIS environment and estimated the soil loss rates. The estimated total soil loss in the watershed was 1,390,130.48 tons in 2000 and 1,022,445.09 tons in 2016 with a mean erosion rate of 51.04 t ha(-1) y(-1) and 34.26 t ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. The study area was divided into eight erosion risk classes ranging from very low to extremely high. We established a change detection matrix of the soil erosion risk classes between 2000 and 2016. The change analysis results have revealed that about 70.80% of the soil erosion risk areas remained unchanged, 19.67% increased in total area, and 9.53% decreased, showing an overall worsening of the situation. We identified and mapped areas with a higher and increasing erosion risk as SWC priority areas using a Multi-criteria Decision Rules (MCDR) method. The top three priority levels marked for the emergency SWC measures account for about 0.04%, 0.49%, and 0.83%, respectively. These priority levels are situated along the steep slope areas in the north, northwest, south, and southeast of the Gobele Watershed. It is, thus, very critical to undertake proper intervention measures in upslope areas based on the priority levels to establish sustainable watershed management in the study area.

AB We developed a multi-scale conservation planning framework for brook trout (Salvelinus fontinails) within the Chesapeake Bay watershed that incorporates both land use and climate stressors. Our specific objectives were to (1) construct a continuous spatial model of brook trout distribution and habitat quality at the stream reach scale; (2) characterize brook trout vulnerability to climate change under a range of future climate scenarios; and (3) identify multi-scale restoration and protection priorities for brook trout across the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Boosted regression tree analysis predicted brook trout occurrence at the stream reach scale with a high degree of accuracy (CV AUC = 0.92) as a function of both natural (e.g., water temperature and precipitation) and anthropogenic (e.g., agriculture and urban development) landscape and climatic attributes. Current land use activities result in a predicted loss of occurrence in over 11,000 stream segments (40% of suitable habitat) and account for over 15,000 km (45% of current value) of lost functional brook trout fishery value (i.e., length-weighted occurrence probability) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Climate change (increased ambient temperatures and altered precipitation) is projected to result in a loss of occurrence in at least 3000 additional segments (19% of current value) and at least 3000 km of functional fishery value (9% of current value) by 2062. Model outcomes were used to identify low- and high-quality stream segments within relatively intact and degraded sub-watersheds as restoration and protection priorities, respectively, and conservation priorities were targeted in watersheds with high projected resilience to climate change. Our results suggest that traditional restoration activities, such as habitat enhancement, riparian management, and barrier removal, may be able to recover a substantial amount of brook trout habitat lost to historic landscape change. However, restoration efforts must be designed within the context of expected impacts from climate change or those efforts may not produce long-term benefits to brook trout in this region.

AB Hotspot analysis is a commonly used method in ecology and conservation to identify areas of high biodiversity or conservation concern. However, delineating and mapping hotspots is subjective and various approaches can lead to different conclusions with regard to the classification of particular areas as hotspots, complicating long-term conservation planning. We present a comparative analysis of recent approaches for identifying waterbird hotspots, with the goal of developing insights about the appropriate use of these methods. We selected four commonly used measures to identify persistent areas of high use: kernel density estimation, Getis-Ord G(i)*, hotspot persistence and hotspots conditional on presence, which represent the range of quantitative hotspot estimation approaches used in waterbird analyses. We applied each of the methods to aerial survey waterbird count data collected in the Great Lakes from 2012-2014. For each approach, we identified areas of high use for seven species/species groups and then compared the results across all methods and to mean effort-corrected counts. Our results indicate that formal hotspot analysis frameworks do not always lead to the same conclusions. The kernel density and Getis-Ord G(i)* methods yielded the most similar results across all species analysed and were generally correlated with mean effort-corrected count data. We found that these two models can differ substantially from the hotspot persistence and hotspots conditional on presence estimation approaches, which were not consistently similar to one another. The hotspot persistence approach differed most significantly from the other methods but is the only method to explicitly account for temporal variation. We recommend considering the ecological question and scale of conservation or management activities prior to designing survey methodologies. Deciding the appropriate definition and scale for analysis is critical for interpretation of hotspot analysis results as is inclusion of important covariates. Combining hotspot analysis methods using an integrative approach, either within a single analysis or post hoc, could lead to greater consistency in the identification of waterbird hotspots.

AB The coastal marine fisheries are threatened with collapse due to the increase of the fishing effort and the anthropogenic impacts that directly and indirectly degrade the habitat and the ecological systems of which the fishing activity depends. The bycatch and discard are equal to one third (1/3) of the total landings of biomass. Particularly, the bycatch of the shrimp trawl fishery in tropical waters represents 27% of global discard, which is a serious ecological problem for fisheries management. Therefore. there is a necessity of additional fisheries management measures to those used traditionally that contribute to protect the fishing resources and to improve fishing production. The Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have emerged as a tool for marine conservation and fisheries management. The purpose of this work is to identify potentials MPAs for the fisheries management of the demersal resources by means of an analysis of the relationship among the spatial distribution of population and ecological aspects of these resources in the northern area of the Colombian Caribbean Sea with the habitat characteristics (temperature, salinity, depth, sediment type). The relationship of population structure of demersals fishes with the habitat conditions was established, which are important when we want to identify MPAs as a tool of sustainable fisheries management under an ecosystem approach. By means of spatial modelization, the area of spatial distribution of demersal fishes was calculated (5805.8 km(2)) and of this, the juveniles were located between Dibulla and the Buritaca river in an area of 393.1 km(2) and the area of most diversity (297.0 km(2)) was located in La Guajira region, which each represent 11.9% of the spatial distribution of the demersal fishes. We advise for the implementation of Multiple Use -Marine Protected Areas (MU-MPA) in these sectors, that is to say, to make limited use of the fishing resources with a system of sustainable management with the active participation of the fishersmen.

AB Since 1980, northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) range-wide populations declined 3.9% annually. Within the West Gulf Coastal Plain Bird Conservation Region in the south-central United States, populations of this quail species have declined 6.8% annually. These declines sparked calls for land use change and prompted implementation of various conservation practices. However, to effectively reverse these declines and restore northern bobwhite to their former population levels, habitat conservation and management efforts must target establishment and maintenance of sustainable populations. To provide guidance for conservation and restoration of habitat capable of supporting sustainable northern bobwhite populations in the West Gulf Coastal Plain, we modeled their spatial distribution using landscape characteristics derived from 1992 National Land Cover Data and bird detections, from 1990 to 1994, along 10-stop Breeding Bird Survey route segments. Four landscape metrics influenced detections of northern bobwhite: detections were greater in areas with more grassland and increased aggregation of agricultural lands, but detections were reduced in areas with increased density of land cover edge and grassland edge. Using these landscape metrics, we projected the abundance and spatial distribution of northern bobwhite populations across the entire West Gulf Coastal Plain. Predicted populations closely approximated abundance estimates from a different cadre of concurrently collected data but model predictions did not accurately reflect bobwhite detections along species-specific call-count routes in Arkansas and Louisiana. Using similar methods, we also projected northern bobwhite population distribution circa 1980 based on Land Use Land Cover data and bird survey data from 1976 to 1984. We compared our 1980 spatial projections with our spatial estimate of 1992 populations to identify areas of population change. Additionally, we used our projection of the spatial distribution and abundance of bobwhite to predict areas of population sustainability. Our projections of population change and sustainability provide guidance for targeting habitat conservation and rehabilitation efforts for restoration of northern bobwhite populations in the West Gulf Coastal Plain.

AB Natural resource management professionals require adaptable spatial tools for conserving and managing wildlife across landscapes. These tools should integrate multiple components of habitat quality and incorporate local disturbance regimes. We provide a spatial modeling framework that integrates three components of habitat (nutritional resources, connectivity, and predation risk) into indices of habitat quality under a simulated wildfire disturbance regime. Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a species of conservation concern, is used to illustrate our framework. We simulated disturbance from wildfire on two boreal forest landscapes to produce stand ages, from which we computed and integrated the three habitat indicator components using different schemes. Spatial variation in the influence of wildfire and the distribution of the three components of habitat resulted in heterogeneous patterns of habitat quality. The inclusion of disturbance led to a different habitat quality landscape than that of a static model in which the influence of wildfire on vegetation communities was not considered, incorporating the likelihood of persistence into the overall representation of habitat quality. The integration of nutrition, connectivity, and predation risk into a single index of habitat quality produced spatial patterns distinct from maps of the individual components. Regardless of whether the components were combined through additive, multiplicative, or minimum habitat quality threshold methods, areas of very high- and poor-quality habitat were found at consistent locations across the landscape, suggesting that these two types of regions provide opportunities for long-term management interventions. The framework presented here is adaptable and modular; it could be modified and applied to other species, regions, and disturbance regimes. It provides a nuanced representation of persistent habitat and has the potential to be a useful tool for conservation planning.

AB Context: Systematic conservation planning is increasingly used to identify priority areas for protection in marine systems. However, ecosystem-based approaches typically use density estimates as surrogates for animal presence and spatial modeling to identify areas for protection and may not take into account daily or seasonal movements of animals. Additionally, sympatric and inter-related species are often managed separately, which may not be cost-effective. This study aims to demonstrate an evidence-based method to inform the biological basis for co-management of two sympatric species, dugongs and green sea turtles. This approach can then be used in conservation planning to delineate areas to maximize species protection.
   Methodology/Results: Fast-acquisition satellite telemetry was used to track eleven dugongs and ten green turtles at two geographically distinct foraging locations in Queensland, Australia to evaluate the inter-and intra-species spatial relationships and assess the efficacy of existing protection zones. Home-range analysis and bathymetric modeling were used to determine spatial use and compared with existing protection areas using GIS. Dugong and green turtle home-ranges significantly overlapped in both locations. However, both species used different core areas and differences existed between regions in depth zone use and home-range size, especially for dugongs. Both species used existing protection areas in Shoalwater Bay, but only a single tracked dugong used the existing protection area in Torres Strait.
   Conclusions/Significance:: Fast-acquisition satellite telemetry can provide evidence-based information on individual animal movements to delineate relationships between dugongs and green turtles in regions where they co-occur. This information can be used to increase the efficacy of conservation planning and complement more broadly based survey information. These species also use similar habitats, making complimentary co-management possible, but important differences exist between locations making it essential to customize management. This methodology could be applied on a broader scale to include other sympatric and inter-related species.

AB To develop appropriate spatial conservation planning for individual species, it is important to understand their habitat requirements and in particular to identify areas where critical life-history process such as breeding, weaning or feeding take place. The process of defining critical habitat often ignores behavioural aspects of animal distribution, which for highly migratory species like baleen whales whose feeding and breeding grounds are clearly demarcated and widely separated is not a problem. However, for other species like the endangered 'Eastern North Pacific southern resident' killer whale stock, critical life-history processes occur in the same waters. This killer whale stock lives in a topographically complex region (many islands) off the west coast of Canada/USA, which makes accurate mapping of densities or behaviours difficult using traditional generalised additive models. We present results on the spatial distribution of southern resident killer whale feeding grounds in 2006, using a binomial, complex region spatial smoothing model within a generalised estimating equation framework, which allows for both complex topography and correlated residuals. The model performs well and suggests a region to the south of San Juan Island as an area with a high probability of feeding, which could not have been as accurately established from a more traditional presence-absence model. We also calculate estimates of precision, which other studies did not include, enabling more informed management decisions for spatial conservation planning. A vignette containing the code along with an R workspace and function file is provided to allow the user to fit the models presented in this paper.

AB We developed rangewide population and habitat models for Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) that account for regional variation in habitat selection and relative densities of birds for use in conservation planning and risk assessments. We developed a probabilistic model of occupied breeding habitat by statistically linking habitat characteristics within 4 miles of an occupied lek using a nonlinear machine learning technique (Random Forests). Habitat characteristics used were quantified in GIS and represent standard abiotic and biotic variables related to sage-grouse biology. Statistical model fit was high (mean correctly classified = 82.0%, range = 75.4-88.0%) as were cross-validation statistics (mean = 80.9%, range = 75.1-85.8%). We also developed a spatially explicit model to quantify the relative density of breeding birds across each Greater Sage-Grouse management zone. The models demonstrate distinct clustering of relative abundance of sage-grouse populations across all management zones. On average, approximately half of the breeding population is predicted to be within 10% of the occupied range. We also found that 80% of sage-grouse populations were contained in 25-34% of the occupied range within each management zone. Our rangewide population and habitat models account for regional variation in habitat selection and the relative densities of birds, and thus, they can serve as a consistent and common currency to assess how sage-grouse habitat and populations overlap with conservation actions or threats over the entire sage-grouse range. We also quantified differences in functional habitat responses and disturbance thresholds across the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA) management zones using statistical relationships identified during habitat modeling. Even for a species as specialized as Greater Sage-Grouse, our results show that ecological context matters in both the strength of habitat selection (i.e., functional response curves) and response to disturbance.

AB Due to differences in the responses of species to changing landscape patterns, developing a conservation plan with an optimal outcome of supporting contrasting habitat needs can be difficult. Landscape scenario modeling can provide a means to compare alternative conservation strategies and can reveal tradeoffs of managing for one objective versus another. In order to evaluate the impacts of alternative conservation strategies in a 53,653 ha landscape in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, four scenarios of alternative conservation strategies were modeled 100 years into the future using the VDDT (R)/TELSA (R) spatial model suite, and habitat availability was evaluated for five target bird species of local conservation concern under each scenario. The target species were Dendroica fusca (Blackburnian Warbler), Picoides arcticus(Black-backed Woodpecker), Dendroica kirtlandii (Kirtland's Warbler), Buteo lineatus (Red-shouldered Hawk), and Scolopax minor (American Woodcock). Scenarios were ranked based on relative performance of three habitat metric results (total primary habitat area, average size of habitat patches, and average distance to the nearest neighboring habitat patch) for each species. The final overall rank for each scenario was generally related to harvest intensity; the scenario with the smallest total area of even-aged management ranked the highest. Ranks were not consistent across all response variables. Relative species sensitivity was also evaluated, and the ranks did not match expectations, with the more habitat generalist species showing the highest sensitivity and the most specialist species showing the lowest. The approach here provides a means of projecting and comparing potential long-term impacts of alternative landscape strategies on diverse wildlife habitats. These results, when considered with budget considerations and species' habitat area and population goals, can assist local managers and stakeholders in conservation planning by identifying tradeoffs and compromises aimed at optimizing protection for a variety of target species.

AB Rhodolith beds comprise a highly biodiverse and productive ecosystem that dominates the mid and outer shelf of the tropical eastern South American coast. Conservation planning and specific conservation measures are lack-ing, while impacts over rhodolith beds are escalating due to carbonate mining, and other activities such as oil and gas exploration and seaport dredging. Primary data detailing the spatial extent and characteristics of rhodolith beds within the Brazilian Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) depend on extensive acoustic surveys and ground truthing, which are costly and logistically challenging. Here, we compiled an extensive database of rhodolith occurrence from the scientific and grey literature. 'Ensemble' Ecological Niche Modelling (EENM) techniques predicted the total area suitable for rhodoliths across the Brazilian EEZ and gave insight into the environmental variables driving their distribution in this region. Using the suitability map produced from the ensemble model, we compared rhodolith spatial overlap with oil and gas and mining activities and marine protected areas (MPAs). Light, saturation state of calcite and minimum temperature were the main predictors of rhodolith occurrence. Rhodoliths were predicted to occur over-167,379 km2 of the Brazilian EEZ largely (-95%) in the Amazonas (AM), Northeastern Brazil (NB) and Eastern Brazil (EB) ecoregions. The representation of rhodoliths in areas with mining and oil and gas activities was similar for the EEZ as a whole. Within each ecoregion, representation of rhodolith beds in MPAs is negatively related with their overlap with mining and oil and gas activities. Eastern Brazil (EB) stood out as the area with the highest representation of rhodoliths under threat, in an area 6.7 times larger than those represented in MPAs, including the south region of the largest continuous extension of rho-dolith beds, in the Abrolhos bank. Within the NB and AM ecoregions, which are under growing industrialization, rhodolith beds are poorly represented in no-take MPAs. Our results provide a basis for moving toward more effective management and conservation strategies for rhodolith beds in Brazil's EEZ.

AB Habitat conservation for restricted-range species should also consider adjacent areas, but the analytical approaches for such assessments (particularly for a future perspective) are constrained by currently observed habitat relationships. We used two conceptually different habitat modelling approaches for analysing habitat distribution for the isolated Estonian population of a species of European conservation concern, the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans (Linnaeus, 1758)). We expected that the correlative (statistical) approaches based on current location data will increasingly deviate along with the distance from the current range, compared with a mechanistic approach based on limiting factors for the species. For conservation planning, we also investigated how the current protected area network covers quality habitats around the current range. We constructed three alternative correlative models (MaxEnt; Random forest; Generalized Boosted Regression) utilizing remotesensing (Sentinel-2; LiDAR) and forest inventory data for 1299 occurrences in the currently occupied ca. 1400 km2 range. A mechanistic model was constructed as a decision tree that distinguished 11 quality classes of forest land based on the ecological prioritization of limiting factors: site type; forest cover; abundance of key tree species; stand age; patch size; and layer structure. Supporting our expectation, an overall good accordance of habitat predictions of all the correlative models and the mechanistic model (at 30 x 30 m pixel size) declined with the distance from the current range. The MaxEnt model most closely followed the full range of habitat quality classes of the mechanistic model, while the other correlative models emphasized the highest habitatquality class. Within the current range, both MaxEnt and the mechanistic model similarly revealed habitat quality differences between occupied and unoccupied species protection areas. Delineation of habitat aggregations all over the country based on the mechanistic model revealed habitat loss both within and adjacent to the current range, which sets limits to local population recovery. For analysing wider options, we recommend complementing statistical spatial modelling of current conditions with ecologically sound mechanistic approaches. Based on our specific case, we outline how such model predictions can be assessed for management planning beyond current range.

AB AimProtected areas have become pivotal to the modern conservation planning toolbox, but a limited understanding of marine macroecology is hampering their efficient design and implementation in pelagic environments. We explored the respective contributions of environmental factors and human impacts in capturing the distribution of an assemblage of commercially valuable, large-bodied, open-water predators (tunas, marlins and mackerels).
   LocationWestern Australia.
   Time period1997-2006.
   Major taxa studiedPelagic fishes.
   MethodsWe compiled 10 years of commercial fishing records from the Sea Around Us Project and derived relative abundance indices from standardized catch rates while accounting for confounding effects of effort, year and gear type. We used these indices to map pelagic hotspots over a 0.5 degrees-resolution grid and built random forests to estimate the importance of 33 geophysical, oceanographic and anthropogenic predictors in explaining their locations. We additionally examined the spatial congruence between these hotspots and an extensive network of marine reserves and determined whether patterns of co-occurrence deviated from random expectations using null model simulations.
   ResultsFirst, we identified several pelagic hotspots off the coast of Western Australia. Second, geomorphometrics explained up to 50% of the variance in relative abundance of pelagic fishes, and submarine canyon presence ranked as the most influential variable in the North bioregion. Seafloor complexity, geodiversity, salinity, temperature variability, primary production, ocean energy, current regimes and human impacts were also identified as important predictors. Third, spatial overlap between hotspots and marine reserves was limited, with most high-abundance areas primarily found in zones where anthropogenic activities are subject to few regulations.
   Main conclusionsThis study reveals geomorphometrics as valuable indicators of the distribution of mobile fish species and highlights the relevance of harnessing static topography as a key element in any blueprint for ocean zoning and spatial management.

AB 1. Optimizing the design of marine protected area (MPA) networks for the conservation of migratory marine species and their habitats involves a suite of important considerations, such as appropriate scale requirements and the distribution of anthropogenic impacts. Often, a fundamental component of the conservation planning process is delineating areas of high use or high biodiversity within a region of interest. 2. However, basing conservation strategies off merely the number of individuals in an ecosystem is outdated and potentially subject to arbitrary thresholds. To be effective at protecting marine megafauna, MPAs would ideally encompass habitats used by focal species. Through satellite-tracking studies, evidence of whether species actually use protected areas is emerging. 3. Here, we present a multispecies perspective on habitat selection within existing MPAs throughout the Floridian ecoregion, which encompasses coastal Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. Using an 11-year satellite-tracking dataset on 235 marine turtles, we used integrated step selection analysis to quantify the effects of sea turtle behavioural state (identified by a switching state-space model), protected area status, chlorophyll and bathymetry on habitat selection. 4. Our results show that sea turtles do select for existing protected areas, specifically multi-use zones, while controlling for the effects of depth and primary productivity. However, our analysis revealed that turtles showed no selection for the no-take zones within MPAs, during either transiting or foraging. 5. These findings contribute to the existing literature base of MPA use for highly mobile, imperilled species and could inform management of existing MPAs or changes to zoning, specifically multi-use to no-take. Our use of a robust spatial modelling framework to evaluate habitat selection relative to MPAs could be incorporated into conservation planning to build MPA networks designed to accommodate migratory species.

AB Understanding the distribution and structure of biotopes is essential for marine conservation according to international legislation, such as the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). The biotope 'Sea Pen and Burrowing Megafuna Communities' is included in the OSPAR list of threatened and/or declining habitats. Accordingly, the MSFD prescribes a monitoring of this biotope by the member states of the EU. In the German North Sea, however, the distribution and spatial extent of this biotope as well as the structuring of its benthic species inventory is unknown. We used an extensive geo-referenced dataset on occurrence, abundance and biomass of the benthic infauna of the south-eastern North Sea to estimate the distribution of the biotope and to characterize the associated infauna assemblages. Sediment preferences of the burrowing megafauna, comprising decapod crustaceans and echiurids, were identified and the core distribution areas of the burrowing megafauna were modelled using Random Forests. Clusters of benthic infauna inside the core distribution areas were identified by fuzzy clustering. The burrowing megafauna occurred on a wide range of sediments with varying mud contents. The core distribution area of the burrowing megafauna was characterized by elevated mud content and a water depth of 25-55 m. The analysis of the benthic communities and their relation to sedimentological conditions identified four infauna clusters of slightly varying species composition. The biotope type 'Sea Pen and Burrowing Megafuna Communities' is primarily located inside the paleo valley of the river Elbe and covers an area of 4980 km(2). Dedicated monitoring will have to take into account the spatial extent and the structural variability of the biotope. Our results can provide a baseline for the evaluation of the future development of the environmental status of the biotope. The maps generated herein will facilitate the communication of information relevant for environmental management to authorities and policy makers.

AB Predictive habitat mapping has shown great promise to improve the understanding of the spatial distribution and complexity of benthic habitats and is a valuable means to highlight species-environment relationships where field data are limited. Although spatial distribution models may represent an important step forward in science based ecosystem management, reliable predictions are hard to obtain in deep-sea environments, mainly owing to the usual paucity of high resolution maps in these settings. The aim of this study is to apply and test different spatial models to statistically predict the distribution of two Cold-Water Coral (CWC) species (Madrepora oculata, Dendrophyllia cornigera) in the Cap de Creus Canyon (NW Mediterranean), based on high-resolution swath-bathymetry (5 m resolution) and video observations through the manned submersible JAGO (IFM-GEOMAR). Several submarine canyons host CWC communities, as the environmental conditions tend to be particularly suitable for their settlement and development. Along the Cap de Creus Canyon, presence/absence of CWC was estimated in each 5 m resolution pixel based on video imagery. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), General Additive Model (GAM) and Random Forest were applied to represent non-linear species-environment relationships using terrain variables derived from multibeam bathymetry (slope, rugosity, aspect, backscatter). According to the models, CWC were most likely to be found on the steep walls of the southern flank which face the head and the thalweg of the canyon, aligning with the known CWC ecology acquired from previous studies. Outputs from the three models showed similar average performances in predicting CWC distribution from the available environmental variables. Slope and aspect for Madrepora oculata, and rugosity for Dendrophyllia cornigera drive their distribution, although in some cases the three models identified different variables controlling each species. To reduce differences and associated uncertainties between model outputs, 5 m resolution ensembles were produced for the two species. As a final step, an up-scaled 50 m resolution predictive map based on the fine scale ensembles is proposed as a valuable contribution for stakeholders, which need to manage large natural areas using objective and repeatable science-based approaches.

AB Population dynamics models incorporating density dependence and habitat heterogeneity are useful tools to explain and project the spatiotemporal variation of wildlife abundance. Despite their wide application in ecology and conservation biology, the inference and projection of these models may be problematic when residual spatial auto correlation (SAC) is found. We aimed to improve the inference and projection of population dynamics models by accounting for residual SAC. We considered three Gompertz models that incorporated density dependence and the effect of wetland habitat to explain and project the abundance of Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). We compared a conventional model that did not account for residual SAC (ENV) with two novel models accounting for residual SAC, one incorporating a spatial effect (a spatially autocorrelated process error) that did not vary over time (STA) and the other incorporating a spatial effect that varied over time (DYN). We evaluated model inference using data from 1974 to 1998 and projection using data from 1999 to 2010. We then forecasted Mallard abundance from 2011 to 2100 under different levels of wetland habitat loss. The DYN model eliminated residual SAC and had better model fit than the ENV and STA models (Delta(D) over bar = 2498.3 and 1988.8, respectively). The projection coverage rate of the DYN model was the closest to the nominal value among the three models. The DYN model forecasted smaller areas with decrease in Mallard abundance under future wetland habitat loss than the ENV and STA models. The novel and conventional population dynamics models we considered in this study, combined with the practical model evaluation approach, can provide reliable inference and projection of wildlife abundance, and thus have wide application in ecological studies and conservation practices that aim to understand and project the spatiotemporal variation of wildlife abundance under environmental changes. In particular, when conservation decision-making is based on model projections, the DYN may be used to minimize the risk of reducing conservation effort in areas that still have high conservation value, due to its favorable projection performance.

AB As a form of environmental degradation, soil degradation directly or indirectly affects many lives through decreased agricultural yields, increased flooding and habitat loss. Soil loss has been increasing in most parts of the world and is most pronounced in tropical developing countries where there is poor or zero soil and water conservation (SWC) planning and management activities. Identifying areas prone to soil erosion has also been inadequate, having not been informed by dedicated scientific studies. This is true of the poorly understood watershed of Welmel in the Oromia region of Ethiopia, where most livelihoods heavily rely upon agriculture. To plan effective SWC management techniques, a solid knowledge of spatial variations across different climate, land use and soil erosion is essential. This study has aimed at identifying potential areas needing SWC practices through conducting a spatial modeling of soil erosion within the Welmel watershed's Genale Dawa basin using a geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing (RS), multiple factors as land uses and climate. The Welmel catchment is located in southeastern Ethiopia and extends between 5 degrees 0'0 '' N-7 degrees 45'00 '' N and 39 degrees 0'0 '' E-41 degrees 15'0 '' E. The revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE), which was previously adapted to Ethiopian conditions, was used to estimate potential soil loss. It used information on interpolated rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), vegetation cover (C) and topography (LS) from a digital elevation model (DEM) and that of conservation practices (P) from satellite images. The study demonstrates that the RUSLE using GIS and RS considering different climates and land management practices provides a great advantage in that it allows one to spatially analyze multilayer data in order to identify soil erosion-prone areas and thereby develop the most appropriate watershed management strategy. The mean soil loss was determined to be 31 tons ha(-1) year(-1) and it varied between 0 and 169 tons ha(-1)year(-1). About 79% of the watershed lies within the tolerable level of 11 tons ha(-1)year(-1). However, the remaining 21% has a high soil truncation trait, mainly due to its steeper slope and use as cultivated land. Our study identifies cultivated and deforested areas of the watershed as the potential SWC practice demanding areas. Thus, the application of RUSEL using GIS across different land management practices and climate zones is a potential tool for identifying SWC demanding sites. This remains helpful in efforts towards sustainable land management practices for the sustainable livelihood of the local human population.

AB Spatial modeling over broad scales can potentially direct conservation efforts to areas with high species-specific abundances. We examined the performance of regional models for predicting bird abundance at spatial scales typically addressed in conservation planning. Specifically, we used point count data on wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) and blue-winged warbler (Vermivora cyanoptera) from 2 time periods (19951998 and 20062007) to evaluate the ability of regional models derived via Bayesian hierarchical techniques to predict bird abundance. We developed models for each species within Bird Conservation Region (BCR) 23 in the upper midwestern United States at 800-ha, 8,000-ha, and approximately 80,000-ha scales. We obtained count data from the Breeding Bird Survey and land cover data from the National Land Cover Dataset (1992). We evaluated predictions from the best models, as defined by an information-theoretic criterion, using point count data collected within an ecological subregion of BCR 23 at 131 count stations in the 1990s and again in 20062007. Competing (Deviance Information Criteria <5) blue-winged warbler models accounted for 67% of the variability and suggested positive associations with forest edge and proportion of forest at the 8,000-ha scale, and negative associations with forest patch area (800-ha) and wetness (800-ha and 80,000?ha). The regional model performed best for blue-winged warbler predicted abundances from point counts conducted in Iowa during 19951996 (rs?=?0.57; P?=?0.14), the survey period that most closely aligned with the time period of data used for regional model construction. Wood thrush models exhibited positive correlations with point count data for all survey areas and years combined (rs?=?0.58, P?=?0.001). In comparison, blue-winged warbler models performed worse as time increased between the point count surveys and vintage of the model building data (rs?=?0.03, P?=?0.92 for Iowa and rs?=?0.13, P?=?0.51 for all areas, 2006-2007), likely related to the ephemeral nature of their preferred early successional habitat. Species abundance and sensitivity to changing habitat conditions seems to be an important factor in determining the predictive ability of regional models. Hierarchical models can be a useful tool for concentrating efforts at the scale of management units and should be one of many tools used by land managers, but we caution that the utility of such models may decrease over time for species preferring relatively ephemeral habitats if model inputs are not updated accordingly.

AB Extreme wildfire events, such as the Pantanal 2020 megafires, are expected to become more common. Assessing the impacts of such extreme events on wildlife is imperative for conservation planning. Direct observation of carcasses can provide valuable information on how these impacts relate to spatial heterogeneity. Here, we use double-observer carcass surveys to assess the numbers and spatial patterns of direct mortalities of medium- to large-sized mammals resulting from the Pantanal 2020 megafires in a large reserve (1080 km2) in the northern Pantanal wetland. Accounting for imperfect detection, we model the spatial variation in mortality occurrence and abundance, testing the effects of habitat-related variables and wildfire severity using multi-species N-mixture models. We found that 26 out of 27 species of medium and large-sized mammals died from the fires with a mean estimate of around 49 thousand individuals. The most affected species included capuchin monkeys, agoutis, peccaries, tapirs, brocket deer, tamanduas, coatis and capybaras. Direct mortality of mammals by wildfires was affected by landscape factors related to species habitats, species traits (probably related to escape or refuge strategies), and the intensity of the wildfires. Mortalities presented a general positive relationship with non-flooded forests (a fire-sensitive habitat in Pantanal) and with the severity of wildfires. Artificial water bodies, a common landscape structure in Pantanal, had 7.5 times more deaths than other areas. Synthesis and applications: With the approach used, we were able to: (i) identify mortality hotspots associated with landscape features; (ii) simultaneously identify the most affected species and assess the average relationships for all the assemblage of medium- and large-sized mammals. We discuss conservation and management actions in two contexts: species prioritization for rescuing and monitoring; and territory prioritization for fire prevention and fighting.
   Eventos de inc & ecirc;ndios ambientais extremos, como os megainc & ecirc;ndios de 2020 no Pantanal, devem se tornar cada vez mais comuns. Avaliar os impactos desse tipo de evento extremo em animais silvestres & eacute; importante para o planejamento de conserva & ccedil;& atilde;o. A observa & ccedil;& atilde;o diretas de carca & ccedil;as pode fornecer informa & ccedil;& otilde;es valiosas sobre como esses impactos se relacionam com a heterogeneidade espacial da paisagem. N & oacute;s usamos amostragens de carca & ccedil;as com protocolo de observadores duplos para estimar os n & uacute;meros e avaliar os padr & otilde;es espaciais da mortalidade direta de mam & iacute;feros de m & eacute;dio e grande porte resultantes dos megainc & ecirc;ndios de 2020 em uma reserva (1080 km2) no Pantanal Norte. Levando em conta a detec & ccedil;& atilde;o imperfeita, modelamos a varia & ccedil;& atilde;o espacial na ocorr & ecirc;ncia e abund & acirc;ncia das mortalidades, tesando os efeitos de vari & aacute;veis relacionadas com o h & aacute;bitat das esp & eacute;cies e com a severidade dos inc & ecirc;ndios usando modelos de mistura de abund & acirc;ncia multiesp & eacute;cie. Encontramos que 26 de 27 esp & eacute;cies de mam & iacute;feros de m & eacute;dio e grande porte morreram diretamente devido aos inc & ecirc;ndios, com uma estimativa m & eacute;dia de em torno de 49 mil indiv & iacute;duos. As esp & eacute;cies mais afetadas incluem macacos-prego, cutias, catetos, queixadas, antas, veados mateiro e catingueiro, tamandu & aacute;s-mirins, quatis e capivaras. A mortalidade direta de mam & iacute;feros pelo fogo foi influenciada por aspectos da paisagem relacionados ao h & aacute;bitat das esp & eacute;cies, por caracter & iacute;sticas das esp & eacute;cies provavelmente relacionadas a estrat & eacute;gias de fuga ou ref & uacute;gio e pela intensidade dos inc & ecirc;ndios. As mortalidades apresentaram uma rela & ccedil;& atilde;o positiva geral com florestas n & atilde;o-alag & aacute;veis (um h & aacute;bitat sens & iacute;vel ao fogo no Pantanal) e com a severidade dos inc & ecirc;ndios. Tanques (pequenos lagos artificiais), uma estrutura comum na paisagem do Pantanal, apresentou 7,5 vezes mais mortes do que em outras & aacute;reas. S & iacute;ntese e aplica & ccedil;& otilde;es: Com a abordagem usada, fomos capazes de: (i) identificar & aacute;reas cr & iacute;ticas de concentra & ccedil;& atilde;o de mortalidade associadas a aspectos da paisagem; e (ii) simultaneamente identificar as esp & eacute;cies mais afetadas e avaliar as rela & ccedil;& otilde;es m & eacute;dias para toda a assembleia de mam & iacute;feros de m & eacute;dio e grande porte. N & oacute;s discutimos a & ccedil;& otilde;es de manejo e conserva & ccedil;& atilde;o em dois contextos: prioriza & ccedil;& atilde;o de esp & eacute;cies para resgate e monitoramento; e prioriza & ccedil;& atilde;o territorial para combate e preven & ccedil;& atilde;o de inc & ecirc;ndios.
